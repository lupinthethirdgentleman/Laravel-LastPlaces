				  <h2>23 DESTINATIONS LAST PLACES WEST AFRICA</h2>
					<h3>Western Sahara</h3>
				  <p><strong>What does it offer?</strong><br>
Western Sahara is currently part of  the Kingdom of Morocco. Until 1975 it was a Spanish colony and still older  people speak Spanish. The combination of local Saharan culture and Spanish  colonial heritage gives this destination a unique flavor.</p>
                    <p><strong>Last Places West Africa recommends:</strong><br>
                      -Colonial Spanish cities with  rationalist architecture of the 1950s-1960s.<br>
                      -Virgin beaches with monk seal  populations<br>
                      -Nomadic Saharawi Culture</p>
                    <p><strong>Information to travel to Western Sahara:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Tourist visa to travel to Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      For many European nationalities a  tourist visa is not necessary. Other nationalities, consult.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mandatory vaccines in Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      There are no mandatory vaccines.</p>
                    <p><strong>Security in Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      The Western Sahara is safe in  general but it is a peculiar territory since there is a strong pro-independence  social movement and there have been armed activity in areas of the interior of  the territory between the Polisario (armed independence group) and the  Government of Rabat. To visit the coastal area you do not have to obtain a travel  permit. For the interior it is necessary to have a travel permit that Last  Places West Africa helps to manage. It is important to find out about the  potentially mined areas on the border with Algeria and Morocco.<br>
  <strong>Money in Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      The Moroccan Dirham is used and can  easily be exchanged for Euros.<br>
  <strong>Time in Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      GMT / UTC + 1. </p>
                    <p><strong>Electricity and charging camera / mobile batteries in  Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      Voltage: 220 V Plugs: Type C  Frequency: 50 Hz<br>
                      To charge the batteries during the  camping days, we will have the plugs of the vehicles themselves as well as a  generator that will facilitate.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Best time to travel to Western Sahara - Climate of  Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      Last Places West Africa organizes  trips throughout the year, but between November and January the heat is not so  strong. <br>
  <strong>Eating in Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      The traditional drink is the green  tea of ​​China, flavored with mint leaves, as happens in other regions of North  Africa.<br>
                      If you do not have prejudices at  lunchtime, you can try the milk of fresh camel or curd, known as  &quot;zrigh&quot;. Taste the dishes of lamb or camel meat, presented in a  unique container, in which everyone can serve with the right hand (the left is  reserved for intimate hygiene).<br>
                      As for the garnish, you'll find  couscous, rice, sorghum or millet. On the coast you can savor grilled fish and  lobsters. Tea and dates are part of every good meal worthy of its name.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photography in Western Sahara</strong><br>
                      Avoid photographing military or  police controls. Better not to photograph official buildings, or political  demonstrations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mauritania</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>What does Mauritania offer?</strong><br>
                      Mauritania is a desert country with  a lot of personality. It has cultural links with Western Sahara and with Mali.  The great attraction is its people, who still dress in a traditional way in its  majority, the interior desert and the historic cities. In a few days the  traveler can enjoy a very peculiar country, authentic, and with touches of  controlled adventure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Last Places West Africa recommends:</strong><br>
                      - Historic cities of Ouadane,  Chingetti, Tichitt, and Oualata<br>
                      -Parque Nacional de  Banc d'Arguin<br>
                      - Tagant rock paintings<br>
                      - N'Madi nomadic tribes<br>
                      -Adrar Valley with oases and dune  areas</p>
                    <p><strong>Information to travel to Mauritania:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Tourist visa to travel to Mauritania</strong><br>
                      The tourist visa is mandatory to  enter Mauritania.</p>
                    <p><strong>Compulsory vaccinations in Mauritania</strong><br>
                      Yellow fever. Recommended prophylaxis  against malaria but in the desert there is little mosquito.</p>
                    <p><strong>Security in Mauritania</strong><br>
                      The country is quite safe in  general but the authorities ask for caution on the border with Mali (Oualata  zone) due to the insecurity of Mali and isolated cases of banditry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Money in Mauritania</strong><br>
                      The official currency of Mauritania  is the Ouguiya. You can get change in the banks of the big cities. Some hotels,  as well as Mauritanians that you will find on the street (especially in the  capital) can offer you a currency exchange.<br>
                      In Mauritania the places that allow  paying by credit card are counted, so money must be carried in cash.</p>
                    <p><strong>Time in Mauritania</strong><br>
                      GMT / UTC + 1.</p>
                    <p><strong>Electricity and charging cameras / mobiles in  Mauritania</strong><br>
                      Voltage: 220 V Plugs: Type C  Frequency: 50 Hz<br>
                      To charge the batteries during the  camping days, we will have the plugs of the vehicles themselves as well as a  generator that will facilitate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Best time to travel to Mauritania - Climate of  Mauritania</strong><br>
                      Last Places West Africa organizes  trips throughout the year.<br>
                      That said, from November to March  are the most pleasant months to go to the desert, although nights can be cold.<br>
                      From June to August the rifi (warm  winds) cause temperatures to exceed 45 ° C, and from July to September there is  a brief rainy season in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, can cause  flooding after the downpours.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eating in Mauritania</strong><br>
                      In Mauritania, the national drink  is Chinese green tea, flavored with mint leaves, as in other regions of North  Africa. If the case arises, take the opportunity to attend, under a tent, the  ritual of the three teas, which starts with the bitterest until the softest.<br>
                      If you do not have prejudices at  lunchtime, you can try the milk of fresh camel or curd, known as  &quot;zrigh&quot;. Taste the dishes of lamb or camel meat, presented in a  unique container, in which everyone can serve with the right hand (the left is  reserved for intimate hygiene).<br>
                      As for the garnish, you'll find  couscous, rice, sorghum or millet. In the capital Nouakchott, you can savor  grilled fish and lobsters. Tea and dates are part of every good meal worthy of  its name.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photography in Mauritania</strong><br>
                      Avoid photographing military or police  controls. Better not to photograph official buildings and ask permission to  take pictures of people or their houses.<br>

                    <p><strong>Senegal</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>What does Senegal offer?</strong><br>
                      Senegal is often seen as the  gateway to 'authentic' Black Africa away from the themed world of safaris. For  Last Places West Africa, Senegal is a country that has its surprises despite  the mass tourism of some parts of the country (coast of Saly, Bassari Hills...).  The north of Senegal is very interesting, with few tourists, nomadic tribes  that still tattoo their lips, and the sinuous Senegal River, crossed by old  stone and adobe forts of the French colonial era. A good trip through Senegal  should end in Saint Louis, an architectural gem that stands stopped in time.<br>
  <strong>Last Places West Africa recommends:</strong><br>
                      -Calmly walk the streets of Saint  Louis in North Senegal.<br>
                      -Explore the Ferlo Desert, between  Touba and the Senegal River.<br>
                      -Know the Fula nomads. Fula women  continue tattooing their lips with a kind of blue ink.<br>
                      -Visit Dakar and its museums. Take  the ferry to Goree Island (touristy but cute).<br>
                      -Visit Touba on a Friday, see the  Muslim prayer in front of the largest mosque in Africa. A visual spectacle</p>
                    <p><strong>Information to travel to Senegal:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Tourist visa to travel to Senegal</strong><br>
                      No tourist visa is necessary for most  European nationalities. </p>
                    <p><strong>Compulsory vaccines in Senegal</strong><br>
                      None. Recommended prophylaxis  against malaria.</p>
                    <p><strong>Security in Senegal</strong><br>
                      Senegal is one of the safest  countries in West Africa. That said, it is advisable to take precautions in  large cities such as Dakar or San Luis and avoid driving at night (through the  crossing of cattle).</p>
                    <p><strong>Money in Senegal</strong><br>
                      The national currency is the CFA  Franc, common currency in several countries (former French colonies) of West  and Central Africa. You can exchange Euros for the local currency at airports,  banks, or exchange houses. The Last Places West Africa guide can help you  exchange money. The places that allow paying by credit card are counted, so  money must be carried in cash.</p>
                    <p><strong>Schedule in Senegal</strong><br>
                      GMT / UTC + 1</p>
                    <p><strong>Electricity and charging batteries cameras / mobiles  in Senegal</strong><br>
                      Voltage: 220 V Plugs: Type C  Frequency: 50 Hz<br>
                      To charge the batteries during the  camping days, we will have the plugs of the vehicles themselves as well as a  generator that will facilitate.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Best time to travel to Senegal - Climate of Senegal</strong><br>
                      Last Places West Africa organizes  trips to Senegal throughout the year. The dry season goes from the end of  October to June. During the rains (June-October) everything can be done, they  do not impede the trip except in some northern areas.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eating in Senegal</strong><br>
                      The national dish is  tiep-bou-diene, an appetizing stew of rice with vegetables and fish. Meats such  as ox, lamb and chicken are marinated with a peanut sauce that gives them a  unique flavor characteristic of the country. In the coastal areas of the  country you should try the fish and seafood; prawns, lobsters, sea oxen, and a  long list of fresh and tasty products caught early in the day. In the jungle  areas, game meat seems to be the most outstanding delicacy for the inhabitants  of the country.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photography in Senegal</strong><br>
                      Avoid photographing military or  police controls. Better not to photograph official buildings and ask permission  to take pictures of people or their houses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Guinea Conakry</strong><br>
                      <strong>What does Guinea Conakry offer?</strong><br>
                      Guinea Conakry, also known as  Guinea (French Guinea) is a pretty closed country, with very little tourism.  The country's authorities are focused on the mining industry, and tourism is  seen as something exotic and distant ... In Last Places West Africa we believe  in the potential of Guinea Conakry and we think is a country worth discovering,  at least once in a lifetime. In the Fouta Djalon Mountains the mythical Niger  River is born, but the area is especially interesting for being the cultural  and spiritual center of the great Fula nation (Fulani, Peul, Pulo, Woodabe,  Mbororo, Falata) that extends from Guinea to Sudan, through the arid African  Sahel. Culture, landscape, and vernacular architecture give a special flavor to  this destination. Alongside this mountainous region, there are several isolated  tribes each with their identity and ritual masks.<br>
  <strong>Last Places West Africa recommends:</strong><br>
                      -The chaos of capital Conakry and  the Islands of Loos to disconnect from chaos.<br>

Along the coast, the  equatorial sea air mass allows high humidity and heavy rainfall between April  and October.<br>
                      To the north, the tropical  continental air mass carries dry and dust-laden winds ('harmatán' wind) from  the Sahara. The temperature varies considerably with the season, as does the  rainfall, which is much higher in the south. Between March and May,  temperatures can reach 45º C north of the country. On the coast, the average  temperature is between 25º C and 30º C.<br>
  <strong>Eating in Nigeria</strong><br>
                      Nigeria's cuisine is a rich blend  of traditionally African carbohydrates such as yams and cassava, as well as  vegetable soups made from native green leaves. A soup based on the palm fruit  called banga is typical of the country.<br>
                      Praised by the Nigerians for the  strength it gives, the Garri is a cassava grain powder that can be easily  consumed as a meal and is quite cheap. The yam is, whether fried in oil or  crushed to make a mashed potato, is different from green peas and is very  popular. The meat is also quite ingested and Nigeria Suya, a barbecue, as a  method of roasting meat, is a well-known dish. The fermented palm products are  used to make a traditional liquor, palm wine, since it is fermented from  cassava.</p>

The key is to know the best time to see the fauna that  interests the traveler: mandrills in Lopé, elephants on the beaches of Loango,  or turtle nesting in Mayumba for example. Gabon has an equatorial climate, hot  and humid all year round. The small rainy season lasts from October to December  and the great rainy season from February to April. Dry seasons from May to  September (large) and from December to January (small). Although it seems  incredible, the rainy season is the most propitious for tourism, since the days  are sunnier, falling precipitations during the night, being also these of short  duration. During the dry season we found the cloudy sky.<br>
                      We have been in the great rainy  season (April), and it has hardly rained, which has allowed us to make many  walks through the jungle without any problem.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eating in Gabon</strong><br>
                      The cuisine of Gabon is influenced  by French cuisine, so its dishes are somewhat more elaborate than those of  other countries in the area. The diet is mainly based on fish and shellfish,  stewed or grilled, accompanied by vegetables such as okra or cassava leaves. In  almost all meals, rice or manioc is served to complete the menu, which ends  with fruit as the usual dessert. The meat is less consumed, but we can find  chicken, pork, antelope or monkey. As drinks, it is worth mentioning the tea  and a wine made with sugar cane. Gabon smells of cassava leaves, eggplant, palm  oil, grilled chicken, roasted fish, peanuts, chilli, banana, mango and  pineapple.<br>

Between June and September, coinciding  with the European summer, there is a kind of dry season.

That must be clear before leaving. There  is a constant average of temperatures that go all the year around 27 degrees  (with enough humidity). Even so, any time of the year is good for traveling to  Sao Tome and Principe. In November (and until March) the turtles come to spawn  (and from February to almost May you can see the turtles coming out of the  nests), the best visibility for diving is between December and March, carnivals  are celebrated in full February. And before summer the flights are much cheaper  as well as the accommodations. Some people also say that November, although it  is rainy, gives an excellent light for photography.

                      Congo Brazzaville or Republic of  Congo is a country that lives overshadowed by its giant neighbor, the  Democratic Republic of the Congo. This French ex-colony lives with some comfort  thanks to oil without reaching the social balance of Gabon. Interesting  cultures of tropical jungle and savannah to discover, groups of Baka Pygmies  still very authentic, and extensive jungles in the northern region invite  tourists to immerse themselves in the 'easy Congo'.</p>

                      <strong>What does the Democratic Republic of the Congo offer?</strong><br>
                      The Democratic Republic of the Congo,  the former Belgian Congo, later Zaire, is probably Africa&rsquo;s most iconic country.  Immense, giant nation, with areas still unexplored in 21st Century. Visiting  the Democratic Republic of the Congo requires days and good fixer-guide.  Kinshasa does not want and cannot control all the territory marked by primary  jungles, huge mountains, infinite lakes, and flooded plains. Yes, Conrad's work  is still present in the mind of the traveler who enters the Great Congo.</p>

                    <p><strong>Security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br>
                      The Democratic Republic of the  Congo is a huge country with enormous social problems. A long civil war, the  internal struggle for mining territories, and a weak state make it difficult to  travel around the country. The team of professional guides of Last Places West  Africa knows how to move around the country and has good contacts to facilitate  commuting and visits. The most conflictive regions are those bordering Uganda  and Rwanda, given the high presence of armed bands that compete for control of  the mining resources of the region. In 2018 there was a major Ebola outbreak  near the city of Mbandaka north of Kinshasa. In the capital, as well as in  other large cities of the country, the traveler must increase precautions and  avoid certain neighborhoods or streets at night. The key is to always go with a  guide that knows how to move and read each situation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Money in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br>
                      The local currency is the Congolese  Franc. The economy is, however, strongly dollarized.<br>
                      Although in some occasions the  payment in euros is accepted, the most used currency is the dollar, as long as  they are dollars issued from the year 1996 - big head in those of 100 dollars  -, not being generally admitted the one dollar bill. Weak bills are not  allowed, even if they are only slightly damaged. At the airport during the  baggage registers several extortion attempts for holding money have been  reported in the past.<br>
                      The DRC is a &quot;cash&quot;  country. However, credit cards (Visa and Master Card) are increasingly accepted  in some hotels (Grand Hotel, Memling, Fleuve), airlines, supermarkets and  restaurants. ATMs have recently started to appear, particularly in large  cities. </p>
