					<h2>SOUTH SUDAN TOURISM DESTINATION</h2>
				  <h4>Why South Sudan?</h4>
					<p>South Sudan became an independent country in July 2011. Before it had been part of greater Sudan and previously a region named Equatoria ruled by the British. It was during the British colonization that this part of West Africa was declared a ‘Closed District’. From 1916 until 1946 no roads, no Western education, hospitals or mission station where allowed in that territory. This 30 years of isolation explain, in part, why we find tribal structures and traditions that have been lost if most of Africa. The long Civil War (1956-2002) also helped to isolate many regions of what is today the Republic of South Sudan.</p>
					<p>Last Places team visited South Sudan in November 2012  and we fell in love with the new African nation. South Sudan is unique for its  tribes, its wild unspoilt nature, and its untamed spirit.<br>
				    </p>
					<p>Dinka, Nuer and Mundari giant cattle camps are already  a traveller&rsquo;s myth. Every year more and more people want to experience what it  feels like to roam inside one of the many cattle camps along the White Nile and  meet the long horned cows and its owners the Nilotic tribal cattle  herders…tallest and darkest people on Earth. It is just magic.<br>
					  Continuing northwards, towards the Sudan border, we  find the Sudd, Africa&rsquo;s largest freshwater ecosystem with approximately  57,000 km2. It home of the last big herds of elephants in the Horn of Africa and  the refuge for hundreds of bird species. It is also home of South Sudan&rsquo;s  dominating tribal groups, the Dinka, the Nuer and the Shilluk.<br>
					  If we drive (or fly)  eastwards we reach two key regions of South Sudan and major attractions for  those travelling there. First, the mountain region around Torit city and second  the plains of Kapoeta. South Sudan&rsquo;s Imatong, Dongotona, Lopit, and Didinga are  home of several tribal groups and small kingdoms that have survived to this  day. For trekkers and rare flora lovers Mount Kinyeti (3.187 mts.) in the heart  of Imatong Mountain Range is their place to go. For tribal and history lovers,  Dongotona, Lopit and Didinga Mountain Ranges are unique paradises in Africa not  to be missed.<br>
				  </p>
					<p>Last Places organises  tailor made trips to all these mountains regions of South Sudan with expert  guides and all the necessary hiking and camping equipment.<br>
					  The second part of  eastern South Sudan revolves around Kapoeta City, great everyday market place.  Capital of Toposa tribe, one of Africa&rsquo;s most conservative and traditionalist  tribes. Toposa, part of Ateker ethnic group together with Karamajong in Uganda,  Turkana in Kenya and Nyangatom in Ethiopia, are cattle herders and live in  isolated fenced villages. They practice body and facial scarification and  Toposa women still cover their bodies with decorated cow and goat skin.<br>
				    </p>
					<p>From Kapoeta all tribal  lovers can explore Larim and Didinga territories. Unique vernacular  architecture, amazing ecosystem and rich unspoilt tribal culture like anywhere  in Africa… North of Kapoeta, following the Ethiopian border one can reach Boma  National Park, the size of Belgium and the area where Africa&rsquo;s second largest  ungulate migration takes place. Spotting this natural wonder is not easy but  with time and means one can experience Africa as it used to be. Boma also hosts  one of the few remaining mountain tropical forests left in the Horn of Africa.  That forests protects small primates, parrots, rare amphibians, endemic  reptiles and the Kachipo tribe. This tribe, related to the famous Surma or Suri  people in the Ethiopian western side of Omo River, are probably Africa&rsquo;s last  untouched tribal group. An important trek is needed to reach their remote  settlements up Boma Plateau.</p>
					<p>				    As experts in South Sudan  we cannot seize to recommend it as a unique and rare destination in Africa. It  is probably the last place in Africa where you can feel real Africa. </p>
					<p><strong>Tribes of South Sudan</strong><br>
				    <span style="background: rgba(126,199,14,1.00); color:#fff;"> LINK A LA CARPETA TRIBES / TRIBUS + FOTOS </span> </p>
<p><strong>Dinka</strong></p>
<p>Also known as Jieng or Muony-Jang. The people call  themselves Jieng (Upper Nile) or muonyjang (Bahr el Ghazal). Arabs call them  Jiengge. 
  </hp>
</p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  The Dinka is the  largest single national grouping in South Sudan. Numbering about 2.5 to 3  million and constituting of more than 25 aggregates of different Dinka sections  (Wut). The Dinka are found in Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Southern Kordofan  regions. Each Dinka section has a separate political entity with established  rights to a well-defined territory. The main sections and sub-sections and  their geographic locations include.<br>
  The Dinka habitat  ranges from ironstone plateau of Bahr el Ghazal and the flood plains (toch)  between the White&nbsp;Nile River&nbsp;and its numerous tributaries and  distributaries to the rich savannah grasslands of Upper Nile. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The economy is  largely traditional animal husbandry, subsistence agriculture, fishing and  hunting. Ownership of livestock is familial; and is a basis of social  status/standing in society. The larger the herd the more prestigious the  family. <strong> </strong><br>
  The Dinka are proud and  ethnocentric but, nevertheless, hospitable and friendly more often than not  demonstrating a high moral standard, code of behaviour, feeding mannerism and  sense of personal dignity and integrity. The Dinka are least touched by  modernisation; their pride and ethnocentrism must be important factors in their  conservatism and resistance to change. Dinka culture is centred on cattle. It  is the medium of exchange whether in marriage, payment of debts and blood  price, or for sacrifices to the spirits and on major occasions and rites.<br>
  <a name="naming"></a>The Dinka have  large vocabulary for cattle, their colours and take great interest and pride in  the art of making different conformations to which their horns can be trained  to grow. When discussing, debating about anything or in a dance, a Dinka  usually throws up his arms in imitation of the shape of the horns of ox.<br>
  <a name="mariage"></a><a name="politica"></a>The  Dinka are an acephalous tribe. The concept of state and hence political  institutions, structure and consequently authority does not exist among the  Dinka. Each Dinka section is an autonomous political entity in itself.<br>
  Chieftainship is hereditary and  holds the title of beny, which translates into different things such as chief,  expert, or military officer. The spiritual leaders exert great influence.  Except in few cases, the spiritual leaders more often reject secular authority.  Dinka chiefs exercised authority by persuasion not through any known  instruments of coercion and force.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  Initiation into adulthood takes  different styles and ceremonies. They invariably remove the 4 lower canines as  a sign of maturity. A girl&rsquo;s physiological evolution and attainment of puberty  is marked by celebration (usually by women) to demonstrate readiness for  marriage. Some Dinka sections scarify the face to mark graduation into  adulthood and age-group. In some, women of particular status have their faces  scarified.<br>
  The sphere of the living and the  dead (ghosts) interact. Tradition permits addressing God and the spirits of the  departed ancestors and relatives either directly or through a medium in a  special offering place yik, situated in every Dinka homestead.<br>
  <a name="culture"></a>The most  important culture asset of the Dinka is the cattle camp, where all social  activities; traits and behaviours, valour, generosity and respect for social  norms are cultivated. Dinka literature remains orally expressed in songs,  poems, and folklore.<br>
  The different Dinka sections have  evolved their different articles of arts, music and folklore. There are of  course many different types of dance formations and songs. The common art is  that of war: spear and stick. The Dinka start practicing stick and spear  duelling with great dexterity from their youth.<br>
  After 1984, modernity  and foreign ideas (Christian missionaries) have permeated Dinka culture and are  slowly replacing their traditions and customs. Many Dinka have converted to Christianity.  They have adopted either jellabia or European dress and now nudity and wearing beaded  corsets are a rare sight even in the cattle camps.</p>
<p><strong>Mundari</strong><br>
  Also known as Mandari<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  Numbering  about 100,000, the Mundari live north of Juba between the White Nile and Tali  Hills. Mundari-land is wooded savannah lying on both sides of the River Nile.  The western part is drained by numerous seasonal and perennial streams and  becomes swampy during the rainy season.</p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The  Mundari are ago-pastoralist and the economy is centred on subsistence  agriculture and herding of livestock.&nbsp;<br>
  The main crops are sorghum, maize, groundnuts, simsim. The Mundari raise a  considerable number of cattle, goats and sheep that are essential as mediums:  connecting human beings and this world with the world of gods.<br>
  The Mundari are divided into three  sections namely:<br>
  The earlier indigenous population<br>
  The Bora&nbsp;<br>
  The groups of immigrants into Mundari who have gradually succeeded in  establishing powerful chiefdoms.&nbsp;<br>
  The  Mundari society is organised into agnatic exogamous lineages. A landowning  lineage - varying in size from about 15 to over 50 adult males - live in a  chain of hamlets with each hamlet under a family head. A hamlet is occupied by  an elder, his married sons with their dependants and as many maternal relatives  who have settled with them.&nbsp;<br>
  The hamlets may or may not be situated contiguously to form the residential  unit loosely called a village. Big Mundari villages have their own water  supplies and grazing lands but small ones composed of minor lineages or small  landowning clans, often share water and grazing.<br>
  The society is knit together by  social events in the hamlets and in the cattle camps. While in daily tasks new  ties of common residence result from mutual aid and entertainment of  neighbours, the closest ties are still with the next of kin, left behind in the  old hamlets (the people to whom an automatic appeal is made in time of need.)<br>
  Generosity  is highly respected among the Mundari and there are sanctions that are  applicable to the mean, greedy, and parsimonious who may figure in satirical  songs; be teased or spurned in the girls&rsquo; courting-huts. It is believed that  the grumbling and annoyance of mean people arouse will make them ill.&nbsp;<br>
  Unsociable behaviour in prominent elders such as habitually eating at home  instead of sharing their food in the hamlet kraal, evokes criticism. The importance  of sharing is emphasized in Mundari upbringing and the young learn to be  generous by constantly exchanging pipes, necklaces, or bracelets, and passing  on to others anything that is not immediately needed.</p>
<p>Mundari  country is divided into independent village-chiefdoms. The traditional  boundaries of chiefdoms enclose important spheres of partisan loyalty, social  activity and religious affiliation. Personalities whose forbearers represented  the past autonomy of a group continue to wield influence even though they may  lack political authority (administrative chiefs imposed by the  government).&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>Traditionally, Mundari chief is hereditary - male line and is referred to as  chief of the country. There is also the chief of the meeting shade and council.  The performers of rain rites and those for shea trees wield influence; so are  the elders and cattle camp leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  The Mundari culture is oral  transmitted orally in songs, many of which are satirical for correcting  misdemeanour in society, dance, poems and other body expressions that reflect  good, generosity, and other core values of the Mundari. They have developed  physical arts that demonstrate Mundari cultural identity. They have perfected  the arts of war implements and body decorations such as scarification and  beautiful beaded corsets (similar to those of the Dinka). Corsets where  forbidden in 1984 (Sharia law) but today there is a cultural revival among some  Mundari clans, supported and promoted by Last Places.<br>
  The Mundari are highly religious.  They believe God 'Ngun' hears what men say and assesses people&rsquo;s deeds. This  belief helps shape one&rsquo;s life and social behaviour. The Mundari conduct  religious and rituals through mediums, landowning chiefs, who are responsible  for the well-being of their chiefdoms, and the doctors, who are also diviners  and treat sicknesses.<a name="soceity"></a></p>
<p><strong>Imatong</strong><br>
  Also known as Horiyok<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  2.000 Imatong inhabit south eastern  slopes of the Imatong Mountains. The land of the Imatong is rugged low-lying  hilly terrain dissected by deep valleys and gently sloping plains. The climate  is mild with a relatively heavy annual rainfall that supports thick bushy  forests and tall grass.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Imatong economy like that of  their neighbouring communities is traditional with little barter and trade.  They practice subsistence agriculture, but keep livestock and engage in  hunting. The area has a huge potential in forestry and its products e.g. timber;  and hydro-electric power.                                      Without  clear political differentiation the Imatong rely on the dominating age group to  run the affairs of their respective villages. Other important persons that  wield authority include the rain makers, fortune tellers and diviners.                        The Imatong, like other  Lotuko speaking people, are organised into exogamous agnatic clans and families  settled in homesteads grouped in villages. They practice age-set set system.  Their most important social events include hunting, marriage celebrations,  funeral rites and rain-making ceremonies.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  Like the culture of all the Lotuko  speaking people, Imatong culture is orally transmitted through speech, songs,  poems, music and other bodily decorations reflecting the highest values of the  self and the community. They also have perfected the arts of warfare and  hunting. They have drums, whistles made from the horns of games and other  artefacts.                                                              </p>
<p>The Imatong are extremely conscious of the spirits notwithstanding the  fact that they don&rsquo;t distinguish between the religious and secular aspects of  life. They believe in the existence of a Supreme Being and are able to  communicate with it through the spirits of the ancestors and the mediums.<a name="culutre"></a></p>
<p><strong>Dongotona</strong><br>
  Also known as Dongotono<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  Numbering a little over 2000  people, the Dongotona inhabit the upper reaches of north-western slopes of the  Dongotono massif. The physical environment is dominated by large outcrops of  metamorphic rocks adjoined by flat-lying to gentle sloping plains. Their  important settlements are Ikotos, Isoke, and Bira. The Dongotona live in dense plain  and mountain villages a mode that, unlike in other communities, prompts  construction of urinals inside the village.  <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The  rainfall regime is tropical and supports vegetation typical of mountainous  terrain and subsistence agriculture of the Dongotona. The main crops are:  sorghum, groundnuts, simsim, telebun, dukn and sweet potatoes. The Dongotona  keep large herds of cattle, sheep and goats. The  Dongotona resemble the Lotuko in many aspects of their social organisation. The  society is organised into exogamous agnatic clans, some of whom relate to  animals (leopard, bush-buck, monkey, elephant, crocodile, etc.) and lightning,  to which they are assumed to transform into when they die.&nbsp;<br> Like the Lotuko whom they neighbour and with whom they share a lot, the  Dongotona have age-classes but do not perform the &lsquo;new fire&rsquo; ceremony. Their  initiates are secluded in the forest feeding on forest food for 5 days at the  end of which, they return to feast on slaughtered but un-skinned roasted goat  meat, marked by serving as servants of the senior age-class  </p><p>The importance of age-class lies in warfare, cattle raids and other social  events. It is also linked to certain traits and etiquette. Traditionally, the  Dongotona have the rain chiefs as the most celebrated personality who performed  both spiritual as well as administrative functions. The position is hereditary.  No one can be a really efficient rain-maker and not descended from rain-makers  on both sides.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>In addition to the rain makers, there are government chiefs, elders and clan  chiefs. The Dongotona like other smaller communities have lately began to  practice ruling age-class.</p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  <a name="myth"></a><a name="lan"></a>Like  the other agro-pastoral communities in the area, the Dongotona culture borrows  from the Lotuko. It is essentially oral transmitted in songs, dance, folklore  and music. Most of their arts and musical instruments are similar to those of  the Lotuko. The Dongotona revere the Sawa, a sacred grove in the Dongotono  massif where they perform annual rain rituals. The Dongotona bury their dead  outside the hut but like other neighbouring communities but have a practice of  exhuming the corpse or the bones of the dead in anticipation of one&rsquo;s  transformation into the clan animal or in some healing rituals.&nbsp;<br>
  The Dongotona believe in spirits that transform into the clan&rsquo;s animal when the  body dies. They believe that magicians, mediums and fortune tellers can change  one&rsquo;s misfortune through some witchcraft and magic.</p>
<p><strong>Lotuko</strong><br>
  Also known as Lotuka, Lotuho, Otuko  or Otuho<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  70.000 Lotuko live in sixteen dense  villages in the mountains and adjoining plains. Some villages, such as Ilieu  date back to the 14th Century.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Lotuko They are perfectly  agro-pastoralists keeping large herds of cattle, sheep and goats. They engage  in subsistence agriculture with main crops grown being sorghum, ground nuts,  sesame, and maize in the plains, while in the hill they grow telebun, dukhn, sweet  potatoes, a kind of yam, and tobacco. The basic social unit of the Lotuko is  the Hang, which comprises the people who consider themselves as descendants of  a common ancestor in a patrilineal sequence. The Hang and its members observe  norms peculiar to it, which include hospitality, protection and support to  individual people belonging to the clan. Each Hang has its particular animal,  such as the elephant, crocodile and the hyena, into which it is believed that  its members transform into after death. Social age and the incorporation of a  homestead into a village, together with the kinship system, form the basis of  society. A person, atulo can develop his life, rights and duties only as part  of a village and under the protection of the age set organisation.                                                                                                                </p>
<p>The Nongopira  or ceremonial making of fire is held every sixteen years. Two straight sticks  are cut. If they are weak or crooked so will be the men or women of the next  generation. All fires in the village extinguished and re-lighted with the fire  made with these sticks. On this occasion the men of the younger generation take  over the duties of military service from their seniors. They are given a  collective name which they endeavour to make renowned in songs. Men above or  below the age fight as volunteers.<br>
  The graduates are responsible for  the daily running of public affairs and the well-being of the community: they  keep internal peace, settle disputes. The declare state of &lsquo;non-violence&rsquo; in  which no fighting is allowed in the village. The graduates can fire and appoint  rain-makers.</p>
<p><a name="sociop"></a>The principal  functions of a Lotuko chief or king, is to make rain. No one can be a really  efficient rain-maker who is not descended from rain-makers on both sides.  Chiefs always marry as principal wife the daughter of a chief or rain-maker.  Women have equal power with the men in this respect, and there are three female  rain-makers in the district.<br>
  </p>
<p>Magicians are found in every  village and behave like ordinary people while some of them smear themselves  with dirt, belch loudly and repeatedly, and roll their eyes and pretend to  throw fits.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  <a name="lang"></a>The Lotuko  culture shows in the daily life of the village and in the art of war and  warfare for which they are renowned. Cultural artefacts include the shield, the  copper helmets fitted with ostrich feathers, the skin apron worn by women etc. Traditionally,  helmets where used for war purposes and today they are used for dancing. A  helmet is made of human hair, sewn together and plastered with red ochre. It is  decorated with brass ornaments and a plume of feathers of a kind of weaver  bird. The shield, usually of buffalo hide, is bleached white, and three or four  small-bladed spears are carried. The drums, usually kept on the house of drums  in the village, consist of a large drum mother of all drums and five other  drums which are usually kept together. The Lotuko musical instruments include:  a large horn, which is two metres long made of bamboos sticks bound together  and five small trumpet. Most of the Lotuko literature is oral comprising  folklore, stories, songs and poems.</p>
<p>The  Lotuko village consists of quarters, a meeting and dancing place that lies in  the middle of the village and marked with ebony stakes driven firmly into the  ground. The sacrificial stone lies in front of the square. In one side of the  square there is a platform under which initiated men meet to discuss the day.  The house of the drums is also near the meeting square.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>The Lotuko houses are larger than is the case with most tribes in South Sudan.  They are built close together, with a stout ebony and bamboo palisade between  them. Each man has his sheep pen adjoining his house. They keep their houses  and yards very clean, but throw ail refuse into the streets, which soon become  several feet higher than the yards.<br>
  </p>
<p>Lotuko have converted massively to  Catholicism since 1964 with the arrival of Italian missionaries to the region.  Despite the new imported religion, Lotuko still believe in Naijok, a neuter  form, conceived chiefly as bringing death and disease. Everything not understood,  however, is ascribed to naijok. </p>
<p><strong>Lopit</strong><br>
  Also known as Lopet<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  The Lopit people number about  25.000 people and live in a hilly environment.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The  Lopit are agro-pastoralists practicing traditional agriculture as well as  livestock rearing. These socio-economic occupations are carried out both on the  mountain slopes and in the plains.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>The main crops are sorghum, bulrush, millet, pumpkin; groundnuts, simsim, and  okra. They also harvest forest products: honey and shea nuts from which they  press oil. The Lopit, like other groups in the area practice extensive hunting.  They engage in the trade of various commodities: cattle, groundnuts, sorghum,  honey, chicken, handicrafts, okra, calabashes, hoes, tobacco.<br>
  </p>
<p>The Lopit are very proud of their  cultural entity and this informs most of their attitudes and social life. Their  material culture (especially southern Lopit) is similar to the Otuho while at  the same time distinct (especially in central and northern Lopit). They  practice several cultural initiations: childhood (naming initiation),  adulthood, initiation into the camp, and age-set initiation. The Lopit like the  Lotuko transfer power to the younger age-set in an initiation ceremony after  every 20 or 25 years. The village administration and all other affairs are  handed to the new generation. The practice of this initiation slightly differs  from village to the other. Most of the villages in southern Lopit tend to be  influenced by the Lotuko practices while those in the centre and north have  their rites in a manner quite different from that of Lotuko.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  <a name="birth"></a>Lopit culture is  orally transmitted through songs, poems, music that express feelings and  emotions such as love, hate etc. Most of their physical culture and arts is  adapted to warfare, hunting and other socio-economic activities and the daily  life of the people. </p>
<p>The Lopit believe in a supreme being - God, the spirits and their  spheres. Most of their beliefs and customs are influenced by the Lotuko  culture.</p>
<p><strong>Tenet</strong><br>
  Also known as Tenett<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  The 2.000 Tenet are a Murle-Boya  speaking people inhabiting the northern most part of Lopit range, in a hilly  terrain. They number a few thousand people.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  They are agro-pastoralists  practicing traditional agriculture as well as livestock rearing mainly cattle,  sheep and goats. They harvest forest products such as honey, wild fruits (shea  nuts) and hunt on the mountain slopes and plains. The main crops are sorghum,  bulrush, millet, pumpkin, groundnuts, simsim, and okra.     </p>
<p>Like  the Larim and Didinga, the Tenet are organised into exogamous clans and  lineages. The main social events include: Hunting, which they practice in the beginning of the dry season, brings  the whole population of the Tenet into the Kidepo Valley in pursuit of  game.                  </p>
<p> The age-set  system and the kinship-system are fundamental to the Murle social and political  organisation. The outstanding feature of the political system is the position  of the clan chiefs and elders who are treated with the greatest respect.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  The Tenet people have evolved a  cultural regime of oral transmission from one generation to the other. It is  centred round cattle and is expressed in songs, poetry, folklore and dance.  They adorn their bodies with all kinds of markings and drawings of different  animals and birds while wearing different types of beads. The  Tenet, like their kins the Murle and the Didinga are extremely conscious of the  spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Larim</strong><br>
  Also known as Boya, Longarim, or  Narim<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  20.000 Larim live dispersed in  solitary as well as collective settlements around the Boya Hills. The main town  of the Boya is Kimatong at the foot of the Boya Hills. The Larim country is a  rugged and hilly terrain with few shrub covered outcrops lying between the  Kidepo Valley to the west and the Thangata River Valley to the east. The  vegetation is that of rich savannah with high grassland and thick shrubby  bushes. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Larim are agro-pastoralist.  While they engage in cultivation of food crops like sorghum, maize, and beans,  the bulk of their socio-economic activities rest on livestock herding and  hunting of game and fishing. Livestock is the only known natural resource in  Larim country. The Larim are close relatives to the Didinga, the Murle and the Tenet.  They believe they came from Ethiopia as part of the group whose separation into  apparently different ethnic communities was provoked by the dispute over the  gazelle soup. The Larim have lived in their present location since the 18th  century. They have resisted the dominant Lotuko and Toposa maintaining strong links  to the Didinga and Tenet. The  Larim are organised into exogamous lineages knit together by strong ties of  community solidarity; custom and tradition have helped them survive planked by  two hostile communities. The social organisation of the Larim is identical to  that of the Didinga in terms of marriage and dowry settlement, rituals  associated with birth, naming of the child, death and treatment of the  diseased.  The  Larim venerate valour, courage and machismo in their social relations and  economic activities. This is reflected in the trepidation and fright their  neighbours display when the Larim come raiding for cattle. The Larim food  culture and habits is similar to the Murle. Beef and games meat form the biggest  part of the Larim dish. The Larim have initiation rituals for passing into  adulthood, which comes at about the age of eighteen and twenty for boys and  fourteen for the girls.  Although they have not developed some form of  state organisation only that the Larim have a traditional socio-political  system in which administrative power is vested in the hereditary chiefs  respected by all and sunder. The Larim share the same Rain Chief as the Didinga  and indeed perform rain-making rituals in common.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  <a name="demo"></a><a name="ewnv"></a><a name="poliic"></a>The Larim evolved tradition and culture which revolves  around cattle, cattle acquisition and hunting transmitted orally through  generations. Cattle are the medium of exchange.</p>
<p> The Larim are highly religious. Their spirituality is not organised in  some of religion but share with other religions the existence of a supreme  being who the Larim believe controls all life including the health of their  cattle. They believe the spirits of the departed ones still roam around them  and therefore communicate with them through prayers and offerings which they  perform collectively in designated ritual place.</p>
<p><strong>Didinga</strong><br>
  Also known as <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  60,000 Didinga inhabit a hilly  terrain. It rises to about 2,000 feet ending up in a plateau. <strong></strong><br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  It  has sufficient rainfall to sustain thick vegetation and supports a burgeoning  agriculture, in which the people cultivate maize, sorghum, beans, wheat,  tobacco. The Didinga are pastoralists by inclination and agriculturalists by  necessity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  They have two crops per year growing mainly maize, beans, millet, simsim,  pumpkins or tobacco. They engage in craft making, pottery, etc. The Didinga  county has a high potential for commercial farming of wheat, barley, maize,  Irish potatoes etc. The Didinga pan alluvial and fluvial gold from the river  beds. Other minerals with high economic potential include marble, limestone for  cement making, gold and gemstones.</p>
<p>The Didinga society is sedentary  agrarian. This has kind of isolated them resulting in much of the Didinga  traditions and customs remaining almost intact. Didinga youth are initiated  into adulthood every 3 years in a ceremony about the time they have grown their  first head dress.  The Didinga do not practice, as in other communities, infant or  pre-arranged marriages. The prospective couple is guided by their own feelings  and emotions and only after they have agreed to marry does the suitor approach  the parents of the bride. Ongoing to announce the affair he is accompanied by  three friends and takes along 6 goats, a spear and a hoe. Dowry is agreed upon  and settled. Sterility is not a ground for divorce, making divorce rare among  the Didinga. The Didinga are divided  into two main groups: the eastern (more traditional) and western Didinga (more  westernized).</p>
<p>  The Didinga clans are exogamous. There is no definite centre or organisation.  But the Didinga have the office of paramount chief, which is hereditary – a son  or in default a brother&rsquo;s son takes over. There is also a rain-chief. The rain  chief receives offerings of goats to ensure rain and in return gives sacred  water used in local rain ceremonies. Didinga chiefs lead in war and may summon  people for an organised raid. In peace times they arbitrate in disputes among  their own people or with aliens and generally represent their men when a  litigant has a cause to plead before another chief. </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion<a name="political"></a></strong><br>
  The Didinga have musical  implements, drums harps which are sounded on occasions, for example, when either  going to dance, hunt or war. Facial and body scarification as well as body  painting are still practiced by Didingas living in remote areas.</p>
<p>The Didinga like their neighbours live a life that accepts the existence  of a supreme being and the sphere of spirits interacting with the living  through prayers, offerings and gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Toposa</strong><br>
  Also known as <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  700.000 Toposa live in a rugged topography  with hills and ridges cut by shallow plains and seasonal streams. It is arid  with very little vegetation of shrubs and short grass. This environment has  greatly influenced Toposa&rsquo;s mode of social production plasticizing  transhumance.<strong></strong><br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The economy and social life centres  around livestock mainly cattle, camels, donkeys, goats and sheep. They pan gold  and other precious minerals in stream beds. The area has high potential in  minerals resources.  The Toposa are part of a larger  group known as the Ateker cluster, which in the Sudan include the Toposa,  Nyangatom and Jiye; The Turkana across the borders in Kenya; the Jiye, Dodoth  and Karamojong in Uganda. The Toposa  society is organised into lineages of which the family form the small unit. The  Toposa social values and customs are passed onto the children as early as  possible. It has to do with accumulation and keeping large herds of cattle. The  boys are organised as age-sets learn from their fathers and taught how to herd  their livestock. Their first task is to take care of the goats and sheep but as  they become of age, they graduate to a higher task of looking after the cattle.  They then can travel distances looking for greener pasture and water. The girls  on the other hand are taught to look after the home, the farms and to care for  the elderly and children. Tradition has it that important matters are discussed  and decision made in the early hours of the morning before sun rise. Respect  for elders is mandatory for the younger generations. The Toposa society has no  clear political organisation. Indeed the chiefs, sub-chiefs, elders,  fortune-tellers, medicine men, witch-doctors wield administrative and spiritual  powers.  The Toposa  abhor the practice of circumcision and indeed despise any circumcised Cattle  rustling and competition over the scarce resources of water and pasture has  determined the relations between the Toposa and their neighbours. </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  The social events which bring the  Toposa together in happiness and sorrow include dances, marriage celebrations,  funerals and cattle raids. They share certain totems and body marks. The Toposa  culture is orally transmitted through songs, dance, music, poems and folklore.  Being pastoralists, they have perfected their art of war and cattle raiding.  They are able to spy and gather information about the enemy, water, pastures,  etc. with precision. The young men take great care and beauty of their  hair.  The  Toposa do not have an elaborate religious belief. They however believe in the  existence of a Supreme Being and the spirits of the departed ancestors. They  pray and make sacrifices for these spirits as they communicate with them  through a medium. This is done in case of serious disaster e.g. droughts,  epizootics affecting their animals, etc. The Toposa believe that the chiefs,  particularly the paramount chiefs are nearer to God by virtue of their  wisdom. The introduction and easy availability  of light weapons and small arms have a great impact on the life of the Toposa.  The catholic Diocese of Torit is trying against odds to proselytise among the  Toposa.</p>
<p><strong>Jiye</strong><br>
  Also known as Jie or Giye<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  3.000 Jiye live in  the plains at the foot of Boma Plateau. The climate is arid with heavy rain  downpour between April and October. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Jiye herd in a  traditional mode of cattle, sheep and goats. They engage in subsistence  cultivation of sorghum and tobacco. They also practice transhumance, in search  of water and pastures for their herds.  The social  organisation and practice of the Jiye are identical to the Toposa. The society  is organised into exogamous agnatic lineages. The most important social events  that bring the Jiye together in celebrations include marriage, hunting, cattle  raids, and warfare. The Jiye share certain totems and body marks. The male  adults attend meetings, gatherings and functions in which important decisions  concerning the clan or whole community are made. Respect for the elders among  the Jiye is mandatory for the younger generations. The Jiye like the Toposa  have no clear political organisation and functions. The chiefs, sub-chiefs,  elders, fortune-tellers, medicine men, witch-doctors wield administrative and  spiritual powers.</p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  <a name="socio"></a><a name="spirit"></a>The  Jiye culture is orally transmitted through songs, dance, music, poems and  folklore. Being pastoralist, they have perfected their art of war and cattle  raiding. They are able to spy and gather with precision information about the  enemy, water, pastures, etc. The young men take great care and beauty of their  hair and scarify their faces, bodies and have extensive piercing (nose, lips,  and ears).  The Jiye do not have an  elaborate religious belief. They, however, believe in the existence of a  supreme being and the spirits of the departed ancestors. They pray and make  sacrifices for these spirits as they communicate with them through a medium (fortune  teller or medicine person) usually during times of serious disaster, for  example, droughts, epizootics affecting their animals, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Murle</strong><br>
  Also known as Murele. Lotilla, or  Ngalam.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  300.000 Murle inhabit the vast  plains and mountains in South Sudan&rsquo;s Boma region. Large parts of Murle country  are flood prone plains dissected by numerous perennial streams drained from the  foothills of the Ethiopian highlands. The topography suddenly changes to the Boma  Plateau as does the rainfall regime and vegetation. This environment has  influenced the social and economic activities of the Murle.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  Murle are divided into two  socio-economic groups the Plain Murle (Lotilla) and the Mountain Murle (Ngalam).  The plain Murle are predominantly pastoral and their socio-economic activities  centre round the herding of cattle. They practice subsistence agriculture; they  also fish and hunt extensively. The Murle are extremely skilful in the arts of  hunting and stalking game. In Boma where there is high rainfall the Murle  practice agriculture cultivating maize, sorghum, simsim, tobacco and coffee.<br>
  Tradition  claims that the tribe was created at a place called 'Jen', somewhere beyond  Maji in Ethiopia. The Murle have a number of myths and songs about Jen.&nbsp;The Murle society is primarily inclined to and interested in their  present rather than the past. However, the respect for their traditions and  customs is so great that many of these customs have the force of law, which can  be taken also for custom. The Murle social and cultural life  is centred round their cattle. They breed them, marry with them, eat their  meat, drink their blood and milk, and sleep on their hides. The Murle compose  songs full of references to the herds captured in battle or raids from their neighbours.  Raiding and stealing of cattle is a question of honour and valour. Every  important social event is celebrated by the sacrifice of a bull in order to  ensure the participation of the ancestral spirits as well as to provide food  for the assembled guests and relatives. Kinship obligations are expressed in  terms of cattle.   The Murle language has a considerable vocabulary of cattle terms. There  are special words for every colour and colour combination; for cows and calves,  bulls and oxen, at every stage of their growth; for different kinds of horns  and for all the conformations to which their horns can be trained to grow.  Every young man is given an ox by his father or uncle when he reaches man&rsquo;s  estate and spends hours singing to his special ox from which he takes his  bull&rsquo;s name. The Murle  stress the importance of the web of kinship ties. They are more interested in  the links between living people than in their descent groups, clans, and  lineages. Marriage relationship is considered most important, and the respect  paid to parents-in-law is emphasized. When a young man wishes to marry, he  looks to his father and his mother&rsquo;s relatives to provide the marriage cattle.  The bride price is transferred in a ceremony to the girl&rsquo;s homestead. Once the  bride&rsquo;s parents are satisfied with the dowry she is then presented to the  groom. The  dowry is divided among her relatives. The Murle speak of relatives as &lsquo;people  who have cattle between them&rsquo;.  Among  the Murle there is nothing special to mark initiation into adulthood for both  boys and girls. However, boys of the same age could group and give themselves a  group name which is then recognised. The  Murle consider death as a natural culmination of life. There is mourning for  the dead and in the past, the body was not buried but left to the birds and  wild animals. Only chiefs are buried in a ceremony   The chiefly system, the age-set system, and the kinship-system are  fundamental to the Murle social and political organisation.&nbsp;<br>
  The outstanding feature of the political system is the position of the  Drum-chiefs (Red chiefs) at the head of the four drum-ships by virtue of their  guardianship of the sacred drums, their spiritual powers are paramount. The  formal pronouncements of Red-chiefs are treated with the greatest respect. The relationship with  their neighbours (Dinka, Nuer, and Kachipo) is by no means cordial due to their  cattle raiding practices.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion<a name="demko"></a></strong><br>
  The Murle have evolved a culture  centred round cattle and which is expressed in songs, poetry, folklore and  dance. They adorn their bodies with all kinds of scars and drawings of  different animals and birds while wearing different types of beads. Elderly  Murle women still wear the traditional supra lip piercing made of bone or white  plastic. Younger generations pierce their upper lip and place a plastic stick  in the whole. Beautiful beaded crowns are worn by women during ceremonies. The Murle are extremely conscious of the spirits. Nevertheless, they do  not distinguish between the religious and secular aspects of life. They  emphasise the immanence of God as well as the significance of Jen. Anything  they cannot explain such as the rainbow, is considered to be &lsquo;one of God&rsquo;s  things&rsquo;. Every Murle family undertakes - every 5 to 6years - a pilgrimage to a  sacred spot along River Nyandit to pay offerings to water spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Kachipo</strong><br>
  Also known as Kichepo and Suri<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  30.000 Kachipo live in the Boma  plateau of south-eastern Upper Nile bordering the Murle, the Jiye and the  Anyuak. They extend into Ethiopia, where their tribal headquarters is at Koma. The  Kachipo country is hilly with deep valleys. The climate is mild with heavy  rainfall.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Kachipo are predominantly  sedentary, agrarian community with the economy built on agriculture. The rich  fertile soil results in a remarkable size and quantity of crops. Crops planted  are millet, maize, cabbage, marrow, beans, yams, tobacco and coffee. They keep  goats and sheep. They also hunt large game and collect honey during the dry  season. They pan gold in the streams and make pots. They engage in trade with  the Jiye, the Murle and the Ethiopian highlanders in tobacco and pots (Jiye and  Murle), lion and leopard skins, giraffe tails, honey and ivory, rifles and ammunitions. <strong> </strong>The  Kachipo relate linguistically, culturally and in appearance to the Tirma  (Surma) from Ethiopia. They however acknowledge no blood affinity with any other  tribe in the area.<strong>  </strong>Marriage among the Kachipo is performed, like in many other groups,  among people who have no blood relations. The bridegroom collects and pays  dowry in form of gold dusts and nuggets, tobacco, goats and sheep. Divorce  among the Kachipo is said to be difficult.<strong> </strong>The Kachipo practice age-set system, which are fighting sets. Each  of the fighting sets is held in considerable respect by those junior to it. If  this is not shown, the offending set is severely beaten by their seniors.  Initiation ceremonies are held at intervals of about 10 years. They are held on  village basis but all ceremonies take place on one day. In each village a sheep  is suffocated to death, and its dung is smeared on the bodies of the initiates.<a name="ploitical"></a>The spiritual head  of the Kachipo main clan and recognized as temporal head of the Kachipo, lives  at Koma, Ethiopia. The clans have sub-chiefs whose realm is not administrative  but spiritual. The clan chiefs are recognised through symbols or emblems namely  an ivory horn, blown in times of sickness; a drum beaten to announce death; and  a set of fire-sticks for producing fire on certain occasions e.g. beginning of  the hunting season. The duties of the temporal chiefs consist of leading their  villages in times of war and peace, judging cases, etc.<strong></strong><br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  Scarification among Kachipo people is  common but is not universal. It is performed according to taste, but is usually  not extensive. The deliberate creation of keloids is not practised. Both sexes  practise the boring and stretching of the ear-lobes. The result does not  usually exceed three inches in length. The practice of piercing and stretching  the lower lip was stopped by SPLA forces around 1984 when they reached Boma  Plateau and who founded a &lsquo;primitive practice&rsquo;. Until that time the practice  was universal amongst the women, and was performed at puberty or a little  before or after. It was considered a sign of beauty, and the bride price  payable is proportionately greater. The practice is said to have been learned  from their Tirma (Surma) neighbours. Nowadays lip plates are only worn by  elderly women and one can observe priced lips without plate among the women  around forty-five years old. <br>
  </p>
<p>The Kachipo dance is performed by  separately by each sex, with the other forming a ring round the dancers. The  men dance to the tune of the drums. The women on the other hand, dance to their  own singing and the sound made by their hand slapping their skin &lsquo;skirts&rsquo; with  the palms of their hands. Donga (stick fighting) is practiced among Kachipo  young men to show their bravery and as a way to perform in front of young  marriageable girls.                                                         <br>
  </p>
<p>Regarding religion, the Kachipo  believe in the existence of a supreme being – God. They also believe in the  existence of spirits and undertake prayers and sacrifices to God and spirits  either directly through a medium in times of personal and community calamity.  The Kachipo have only one rainmaker, and the office is hereditary. Should his  services be required, chips from a certain tree are masticated, and the  resulting juice is mixed with clay and smeared over a man&rsquo;s body. Rain may be  expected to fall. The same effect may be obtained locally by dipping a stick of  the same tree in water and throwing the latter upwards.</p>
<p><strong>Tid</strong><br>
  Also known as Teuso or Ik<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  200 Tid can be found holed up on  top of Natinga Mountain on the southern tip of the Didinga Hills on the borders  with Kenya and Uganda. The environment the Tid inhabit is shrub covered rugged  hills with adjoining dry plains and valleys. The areas receive fairly moderate  rains.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Tid is a small community of  gatherers. Gathering of honey and other wild forest products is the main  economic activity of the Tid. The economic potentials are honey, gum arabica. The  Tid speak a language similar to the Ik in Uganda. The Tid are isolated on top  of the Natinga Mountain. They neighbour the Didinga, Toposa, Turkana and  Dodoth. The lifestyle seldom brings the Tid into contact with and therefore  relationship with their neighbours is limited. The Tid are completely isolated  and their contact with the South Sudanese State is minimal. The first contact  with outsiders was in the context of war which brought displaced people from  other ethnic communities into New Kush (early 2000s). Some Tid have descended  from Natinga Mountain and are being assimilated into Toposa families thus  losing their culture.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  Tid culture evolved and revolves  round their principal mode of production – gathering and hunting. It is to be  expected that their arts and literature, folklore and stories reflect the  social practices of gathering honey, hunting game, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Shilluk</strong><br>
  Also known as Chollo<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  500.000 Shilluk live on the west  bank of River Nile between Lake No in the south and Kosti in the north. Shilluk  country is flat lying plains that surround the River Nile. It has a moderate  rainfall regime and its vegetation is made up of thick tall grass and few trees  and shrubs.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Shilluk keep few cattle, goats  and sheep; and engage in subsistence agriculture. The main crops are sorghum,  maize, simsim, and beans. The Shilluk  are adroit fishermen and exploit with ease the fish resources of the Nile and  its numerous tributaries and distributaries. Recent ecological changes in the  Sudan have made the Shilluk kingdom an important producer of gum arabica.  Petroleum is produced not very far from the Shilluk kingdom and there could be  oil reserves below its sub-soil. The Shilluk is a  nation sensu stricto; a common territory, a common language, a central  authority to which all citizens pay allegiance, have an elaborate system of  customs and traditions which inform on the attitudes of the people, the exercise  of power and all other social relations. The capital of the Shilluk kingdom is  Pachodo. The Shilluk kingdom is divided in two principal political divisions:  the north and the south. It is divided into 15 provinces each under the  administration of a paramount chief directly responsible to the Rath (King),  believed to be the incarnation of God and is sovereign combining political,  administrative, judicial and spiritual power. The Shilluk system does not tolerate  a prolonged power vacuum following the passing of the sovereign. He is the law  and order and therefore must be immediately replaced. The process of  installation of the new Rath begins immediately once the council of chiefs have  met and decided on a choice.  The Shilluk ascribe to an elaborate  traditional system, orally transmitted from generation to the next, in which  each and every Shilluk clan, except the royals, has a defined role to play in  the kingdom. They participate in the building and repairs of shrines; the  installation of the Rath. Some Shilluk traditions and customs have lost their  values or originality. Most archaic traditions have been dropped, while some  have lingered on although are transforming under the pressure of  modernity.   Despite war and social, economic and cultural changes the Shilluk nation  is still strong around the Rath. Being one of the only kingdoms in South Sudan,  together with Azande Kingdom (Southwest) and smaller ones in Lopit Mountains,  Last Places promotes trips to Pacodo to meet the Shilluk King in its full  regalia. The royal regalia include: throne, skin of Nile lechwe (type of  antelope), giraffe mane, 2 silver bracelets, ostrich feathers, royal spears,  royal stick, beads made from ostrich shells, and many others some of which remain  in the special room. Rath Kwongo Dak Padiet is the reigning sovereign. He was  installed as 34th Shilluk Rath in 1992.&nbsp;The Rath reigns for life from  Pachodo - established in about 1690 as the kingdom&rsquo;s headquarters and site for  coronation of kings. However, the reigning sovereign is expected to found his  own village; and comes to Pachodo only when major decisions affecting the  kingdom have to be taken. There was only one woman Rath in Shilluk history –  Abudhok nya Bwoch who reigned from Thworo village. She is said to have decreed  that no woman should ever be installed Rath since women did not respect her  court. The location of the kingdom on the Nile has  exposed the Shilluk to every danger that came with European and Arab incursions  and aggression down the Nile: slavery and slave trade and the so-called  modernity - Christianisation and Islamisation. Many have converted to  Christianity (south) and Islam (north). Nevertheless, their allegiance remains  with Pachodo. The war has displaced many Shilluk to north Sudan. This poses a  serious threat to Shilluk traditions.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  The Shilluk society has evolved a  material and political culture expressed in the institutions of the kingdom and  the daily life activities, notwithstanding its oral nature. The kingdom rests  on an elaborate system of traditions and practices that go back more than 500 years. The  Shilluk are very particular about body cleanliness; the hair is constructed  into two structures that give the impression of plates of hair on the head.  They wear beads, and other decoration which include cutting dots on forehead  and tattooing on the body. The Shilluk have developed music instruments: a kind  of guitar, flute made from the horns of kudu, and drum.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>The Shilluk control and defence of the Nile channel promoted the evolution of a  navy that used dugout canoes. They imported iron from the Nuba Mountains and  Funj Kingdom for making spears, axes, knives and hoes. The Shilluk have  developed several and different types of dances to mark different occasions.  Their folklore is rich with fairy tales for children, quizzes, riddles, etc.  Neighbours and Foreign Relations and Cooperation The Räth has had a moderating  influence on the Shilluk and the cordial relations and mutual respect they have  evolved with their neighbours: Salem Arabs in the north, Nuba in the west, Nuer  in the south and Dinka and Funj in the east.<br>
  Most Shilluk  have converted to Christianity, while some still follow the traditional  religion. Traditionally, the Shilluk recognise the existence of  two spheres: the sphere of the spirits interacting with that of the living  beings. There is the Supreme Being with his home somewhere in the sky where  people do not do evil. There are also the spirits of the departed ancestors and  relatives, whom one can address in times of distress and tribulations. The  Shilluk believe that the ghost of somebody killed or murdered haunts the  perpetrator.</p>
<p><strong>Nuer</strong><br>
  Also known as Naath<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  2 million Nuer live in the swamp  areas of Upper Nile. The influence of the environment on the lifestyle of the  Nuer is obvious. </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  Nuer  are sedentary (although individual families domicile in solitary settlements)  are agro-pastoralists balancing subsistence agriculture with cattle herding –  Nuer keep large herds, fishing and hunting. The main crops are sorghum, maize, and  tobacco. Some Nuer clans practice yearly transhumance. The arid nature of their  homeland in central Upper Nile dictates their dry season migration to the Sobat  basin or to Zeraf basin precipitating feuds with Dinka groups.&nbsp;Western  Nuer homeland is imbued with enormous deposits of petroleum. The discovery,  development and exploitation of this natural resource is more of a curse to the  Nuer than a blessing. It is the cause of immense humanitarian disruption and destruction  unprecedented in Nuer history. Other natural resources potential include  wildlife, fisheries and gum arabica. Nuer is  the second largest nationality in South Sudan after the Dinka. The Nuer are  believed to have separated - at a certain stage in the past - from the  Dinka.  It is believed that the Nuer rose  as a separate people (from the Dinka) in Bull area at the beginning of the 18th  century under circumstances that continue to inform today their mutual  prejudices and relations with the Dinka.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>The myth, which has several variants, runs that both Nuer and Dinka were sons  of the same man, who had promised that he would give the cow to Dinka and its  young calf to Nuer. Dinka because of his cunning and intelligence deceived  their father and took the calf instead of the cow therefore provoking Nuer&rsquo;s  perpetual contempt and disregard for the Dinka up to today.<br>
  </p>
<p>The Nuer have cordial relations  with the Shilluk from whom they have intermarried with. Nuer cherish  independence and freedom including freedom to invade others and take over their  property, which makes for uneasy and sometimes violent relations with Dinka.  They abhor anything that insults their sense of homeland. Nuer political  organisation and structure could be categorised as a confederation of  independent and autonomous sections and clans. The political life of a village  and the organisation of the cattle camps are in the hands of the elders of the  dominant clan. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  Nuer remove the 4 incisors and 4  lower canines as a sign of maturity for children of both sexes. However,  initiation into adulthood which is usually cutting 5 to 6 parallel lines across  the forehead is undertaken among boys of the same age, which like in other  Nilotic groups form them into an age set.  Nuer arts, music and literature like in most unwritten culture are orally  transmitted over generations in songs, stories and folktales. The Nuer are rich  is songs, dances and folktales. Of the most important handcraft the Nuer have  developed is the dieny (basket for carrying everything including children when  on a long journey). Nuer cultural initiatives that have now become Sudanese  national cultural heritage is the Mound of Ngundeng (adobe shrine pyramid style  erected by a prophet) in Lou.  The Nuer believe in Kuoth (God) the creator but like others, believers  in the traditional systems of beliefs have not systematised these beliefs. The  Nuer prophets arose and left their mark on the Nuer nation. Ngundeng, who rose  in Lou, remains the most revered.&nbsp;Younger and less important prophets have  arose with the last one who left an impact being Wud Nyang (1991-1993). Modernity,  monetary economy, war, discovery of oil have had profound impact on the Nuer  traditional ways. Increased violence has resulted in massive displacements and  movements of people that out of necessity have resulted in some positive change  in attitudes and perceptions.<br>

  <strong>Bongo</strong><br>
  Also known as Ge Bongo<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  2.000 Bongo <a name="env"></a>live in  the southern borders of ironstone plateau and swamps of Bahr el Ghazal, an environment  that has greatly influenced the social and economic life of the Bongo.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The economy is predominantly  subsistence agriculture mixed with keeping of domestic animals, iron smelting  and production of iron-ware. They also engage in fishing and hunting.  The  Bongo population had diminished in the 19th century to the point of  near extinction as a result of Azande raids and Arab slavers. The Bongo have no  concept of a state. The chief is the highest political/administrative office of  the Bongo. Each village simply had its chief, who on the virtue of superior  wealth, exercised a certain authority over the rest of the inhabitants, and in  some cases, had an additional prestige from his skill in the art of magic. <a name="lates"></a><br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  Bongo  culture and social values are expressed in their songs, poetry, physical arts  and dance and folklore which are largely oral. The Bongo make the best tomb  totems from hard wood. Most of these totems have been sold to art dealers and  today it is rare to find totems in Bongo cemeteries. Some examples of these  beautiful carved totems can be found in Sudan Ethnographic Museum in Khartoum. The  Bongo were also advanced in the smelting of iron derived from the abundant  lateritic soil. The iron products: axes, spears, hoes are traded with the  neighbouring communities. The interaction with the modern forces has led to the  destruction of this indigenous knowledge system.&nbsp;<br>
  The Bongo are skilful wood carvers, a craft that endures to the present. They  also give much attention to basketwork, strainers to filter beer, baskets for  carrying things, basket-pots for fishing, basket-work walls of huts and  bee-hives.&nbsp;The other crafts the Bongo manufacture are fish-nets, creels  and snares, fishing-lines made from vegetable fibres.  The Bongo are superstitious, practicing all kinds of witchcraft, sorcery  and magic.  The Bongo, as  a people, are almost on the verge of extinction due to war displacement and  rural migration of the youth. The remnants of this tribe are not in a position  to regenerate the Bongo society as it was before the slave trade. However, the  few Bongo found in Tonj and Wau practice some of their social values and  traditions.</p>
<p><strong>Azande</strong><br>
  Also known as Zande<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  The Azande land is  tropical rain forest that enjoys high annual rainfall. This has rendered it a  very high agricultural potential area. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The Azande are  agrarian as a dictate of the physical environment. They engage in subsistence  production of food crops mainly maize, cassava, telebun, yams, and fruits:  mangoes, citrus, pineapples, palm trees, coffee, etc. They also have exotic and  economically important hard wood trees such as mahogany, teak, Cinderella are  found in Zande land. The Azande engage in hunting and fishing as part of their  economic activities.</p>
<p> In 1948 The Equatoria Project Board was  established to exploit the huge economic potential of the Zande land. The Nzara  agro-industrial complex was founded to gin and weave cloth, produce edible oil,  soap and other produce from the cotton the Azande people were encourage to grow  as a cash crop. This project helped monetise and link the Azande economy to  other markets in South Sudan.<strong> </strong>The Azande society is divided into royal clans. Azande settlements  are solitary i.e. a household consisting of the man and his wife (or wives),  nevertheless they ascribes to certain social norms and practices.<strong></strong></p>
<p><br>
  The Azande socio-political system is an intricate admixture of feudalism,  traditional, political and administrative authority and witchcraft, charm, etc.  After the destruction of their kingdom, the Azande now have chiefs, mostly from  the royal clan who combine judicial and spiritual prowess.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The chief invokes witchcraft and oracles, for which the Azande are renowned, to  determine and administer justice on those suspected of crimes including  adultery, murder through bewitching or evil eyes. In the old days, thieves had  their ears cut off and their backs scored with a knife leaving large permanent  scars.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>Another punishment was to break open an ant-hill and tie the offender on the  top of it, intense pain being caused by the armies of soldier ants that would  swarm over him. Men suspected of witchcraft, and also occasionally thieves,  might be confined in their house and burnt alive. Men accused of committing adultery,  especially with their Chiefs&rsquo; wives, if not killed outright were emasculated  and in addition had their hands, ears and lips cut off.</p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong> <br>
  The Azande culture and art is rich  and is expressed in songs, music and dance in self-praise. There is an  intricate system of oracles and folklore which remained largely oral. The  Azande dance is performed predominantly at night during full moons. The men  stand in circle moving their feel in lime to the drums and swaying their bodies  and heads from side to side the forearms are held parallel to the ground with  the palms of the hand turned upwards.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>At times the whole circle goes round in file with the women forming an inner  circle. They dance to the sound of the drums and sing topical songs more often  rather obscene. Different songs require different ways of beating the drums and  all have a chorus in which everyone joins.<strong> </strong>The Azande produce excellent bark-cloth, baskets woven from barks and  leaves of palm, different types and varieties of wooden craft, tables and  chairs, bow and arrows and special iron knives and swords.  Regarding beliefs and religion, the Azande demonstrate a high degree of  superstition and are prone to witchcraft and charms. There is nothing as a  natural death among the Azande. No matter the cause of a person&rsquo;s death, he/she  is supposed to have been bewitched.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nyangatom</strong><br>
  Also known as Bume<br>
  </p>
<p>In the course of  their early migration from Uganda, the pastoral ancestors of the Nyangatom had  been scorned as ''Elephant-eaters'' (Nyam-etom), a nickname which they aptly  transformed into ''Yellow Guns'' (Nyang-atom), that underlined the martial  intentions of their emerging community. The Nyangatom are linguistically and  ethnically closely related to the Toposa. A century ago, both tribes were known  as ''Hum'' or ''Kum''. A name that still survives is '' Bume'' - the Ethiopian  name of the Nyangatom.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  6.000 Nyangatom<strong> </strong>live between Mount Naita, near the Ethiopian border, and Ilemi  Triangle. On the Omo River banks (Ethiopia) we find 11.000 Nyangatom, therefore  the tribe is traditionally considered more Ethiopian than South Sudanese. In  the Toposa villages north of Kapoeta, especially among the Peymong section, one  meets well established Nyangatom families with zebu cattle, sheep and goats,  donkeys, wives and children.The Nyangatom territory is dry and rocky and the climate  of the whole area is hot with low rainfall. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  The  Nyangatom are semi-nomadic agro-pastoralists. They live on sorghum, maize, soya  beans and tobacco cultivation, but their cultural preference is zebu cattle and  small stock raising. They also keep donkeys for their migrations between  Ethiopia and South Sudan. If the Nyangatom and the Toposa are allies, both  groups face common, permanent or potential, enemies. While on transhumance in  the Ilemi Triangle, the Nyangatom fear, on their southern flank, Turkana raids,  while to their north they consider the Kachipo and Surma as irreducible foes.  Since the 1990's the Nyangatom, armed with automatic guns, managed to push the  Surma far away to the north. It is in this movement that they established,  together with the Toposa, an important pastoral and military settlement on the  foot of Mount Naita, on traditional Surma territory on and around the Ethio-South  Sudanese border.&nbsp;The Nyangatom share with other peoples of the Karimojong  cluster the main features of their social organization. They are divided into  patrilineal descent clans. <br>
  </p>
<p>The  main originality of Nyangatom society is a generation-set system which,  embracing men and women alike, allowed the Nyangatom to separate from their  parent stock and to become an autonomous polity. <br>
  </p>
<p>Each generation is given a social identity through the name of an  Aristotelician species. Thus, Nyangatom ethno-history is recording the  founders, their sons the wild dogs, then the zebras, the tortoises, the  mountains (extinct generations), then the elephants, the ostriches, the  antelopes, the buffaloes (living generations). <br>
  For their political and economic  integration, they balance between two options : the Ethiopian, with the  regional community of the Southern Nations, &lsquo;Nationalities and Peoples&rsquo;, around  the town of Jinka; and the South Sudanese, with the membership, which they  share with the Toposa, of the Mount Naita community. Not surprisingly, as many  other people living on border areas, the Nyangatom try to take advantage of  their ambiguous, and too often uncomfortable, situation.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  The Nyangatom  are famous for their oratory gifts and their cattle songs are learned by neighbours  of other language families. Reciprocally, the Nyangatom appreciate and acquire  pots from Surma and Karo women in Ethiopia because their own wives have not  mastered the skill of pottery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Turkana</strong><br>
  Also known as Turkan or NiTurkana. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
  100.000 live in the vast dry plain  of Ileni Triangle in South Sudan. The Turkana rely on several rivers. When  these rivers flood, new sediment and water extend onto the river plain that is  cultivated after heavy rainstorms, which occur infrequently. When the rivers  dry up, open-pit wells are dug in the riverbed; these are used for providing  water to the livestock and also for human consumption. There are few, if any,  developed wells for community and livestock drinking water, and often families  must travel several hours searching for water for their livestock and  themselves.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
  They are mainly  semi-nomadic pastoralists. The Turkana are noted  for raising&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel" title="Camel">camels</a>&nbsp;and  weaving baskets. Livestock is an important aspect of Turkana culture.  Goats, camels, donkeys and zebu are the primary herd stock utilized by the  Turkana people. In this society, livestock functions not only as a milk and  meat producer, but as form of currency used for bride-price negotiations and  dowries. Often, a young man will be given a single goat with which to start a  herd, and he will accumulate more via animal husbandry. In turn, once he has  accumulated sufficient livestock, these animals will be used to negotiate for  wives.  In  their oral traditions, they designate themselves&nbsp;<em>the people of the grey  bull</em>, after the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebu" title="Zebu">Zebu</a>,  the domestication of which played an important role in their history. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
  The Turkana people have elaborate  clothing and adornment styles. Clothing is used to distinguish between age  groups, development stages, occasions and status of individuals or groups in  the Turkana community. Traditionally, both men and women wear wraps made of  rectangular woven materials and animal skins. Today, these cloths are normally purchased,  having been manufactured in Kenya. Often, men wear their wraps similar to  tunics, with one end connected with the other end over the right shoulder, and  carry wrist knives made of steel and goat hide. Men also carry stools and will  use these for simple chairs rather than sitting on the hot midday sand. These  stools also double as headrests, keeping one's head elevated from the sand, and  protecting any ceremonial head decorations from being damaged. It is also not  uncommon for men to carry several staves; one is used for walking and balance  when carrying loads; the other, usually slimmer and longer, is used to prod  livestock during herding activities. Women will customarily wear necklaces, and  will shave their hair completely which often has beads attached to the loose  ends of hair. Men wear their hair shaved. Women wear two pieces of cloth, one  being wrapped around the waist while the other covers the top. Traditionally  leather wraps covered with ostrich egg shell beads were the norm for women's undergarments,  though these are now uncommon in many areas.</p>
<p>  A clear boundary is not drawn  between the sacred and the profane in Turkana society. In this regard, Turkana  traditional religion is undifferentiated from Turkana social structure or  epistemological reality—the religion and the culture are one. The Turkana are  pastoralists whose lives are shaped by the extreme climate in which they live.  Each day, one must seek to find the blessings of life—water, food, livestock,  wives, children—in a manner that appeases the ancestral spirits and is in  harmony with the peace within the community. Properly following the traditions  in daily life will certainly lead to blessing. Blessings are understood to be  an increase in wealth, whether livestock, children, wives or even food. It is  only through proper relationships with God and the ancestors, proper protection  from evil, and participation in the moral economy of the community that one can  be blessed.   Essentially, Turkana believe in the reality of a Supreme Being named  Akuj. Not much is known about Akuj other than the fact that he alone created  the world and is in control of the blessings of life. There is also a belief in  the existence of ancestors, yet these are seen to be malevolent, requiring  animal sacrifices to be appeased when angry. When angered or troubled, the  ancestors will possess people in the family in order to verbally communicate  with their family. There is also the recognition of The Ancestor, Ekipe, who is  seen as much more active in the everyday lives of people, yet only in negative  ways. There is much concern over protecting one&rsquo;s family and oneself from the  evil of the Ekipe. Turkana Christians and missionaries equate Ekipe with the  biblical character of Devil or Satan and this has shifted more traditional  understandings of Ekipe. Turkana religious specialists, continue to act as  intermediaries between living people and ancestors and also help in problem  solving in communities.</p>
<p><strong>Art and Architecture of South Sudan</strong><br>
  <strong>Vernacular architecture of South Sudan</strong><br>
  South Sudan hosts some of Africa&rsquo;s best  examples of vernacular architecture. Tribal vernacular architecture, as opposed  to the rest of the African Continent, is still thriving in South Sudan. This is  due to the fact that most tribes still live far away from the globalizing  currents and economic changes that have affected most Africa societies. Vernacular  architecture is commonly recognized as the fundamental expression of the  world&rsquo;s cultural diversity. The desire for modernization and the well-known  globalization phenomenon are some of the most frequent evoked issues  responsible for endangering the survival of vernacular heritage in Africa. In  Last Places we aim to highlight the outstanding universal value of vernacular  architectural heritage in South Sudan and to raise awareness to the increasing  need, not only the protection of these structures&rsquo; integrity but also for the  preservation of such ancient and sustainable building techniques as a living  heritage.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Beaded Corsets of South  Sudan</strong><br>
  One of South Sudan&rsquo;s most unique and spectacular forms of art is the  making of beaded corsets. Dinka and Mundari women still make them to decorate  the bodies of both men and women during special occasions.<br>
  </p>
<p>Dinka and Mundari corsets are made up of  thousands of tiny glass beads in various colours and are usually supported by  strong wires at the spin. Beadwork is an expression of the creativity and is an  important part of adornment traditions of the Dinka and Mundari. The corsets  are used as symbol of wealth and social status, therefore an indicator of  gender, age, wealth, and ethnic affiliations. The colours of the beads indicate  the age of the wearer; young Dinka between 15-25 years-old will wear a corset  made of red and black beads. The use of pink and purple are appropriated to a  man between 25-30 years old while yellow beads are worn by wearers of over 30  years old. The combination of colours including blue, green, white, black, and  red is frequently used. This composition may appear purely aesthetic. Until  1984, when beaded corsets where forbidden by Khartoum government (they  considered them to be sinful), corsets were used on a daily basis by both men  and women. Women&rsquo; corsets Alual are different from those worn by men and often  decorated with cowry shells. They are of a looser, bodice style and when worn,  women&rsquo; corsets appear ample and hang from the neck like a large necklace. In  some rare cases, young girls will wear a tight corset with an important  projection in the back such as those of the men. This corset will remain on her  and will be cut open only at her wedding. Corsets for men Malual are worn tight  and are characterized by a high projection on the back usually seen as  indicator of the wealth of the wearer&rsquo;s family. Dinka young warrior would keep  his corset on him and will change it only when he reaches another group age.  Last Places is promoting the revival of corsets as a beautiful and unique work  of art and part of Mundari and Dinka identity.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Artisan products of South Sudan</strong><br>
  Most tribes in South  Sudan are semi-nomadic pastoralists. This means they cannot carry heavy items  on their transhumance trips. Their art production is related to decorative (the  body) and functional objects such as:<br>
  -Lip and ear piercings<br>
  -ivory and metal  bracelets and rings<br>
  -beaded (glass, ceramic,  and plastic) necklaces and corsets<br>
  -wooden headrests<br>
  -skin and wooden  shields<br>
  -spears and knives<br>
  -hats and helmets used  for dance<br>
  -smoking pipes made of  metal or clay<br>
  -loincloth made of  animal skin decorated with bead and cowry shells<br>
  -decorated calabashes<br>
  -animal figures made of  clay<br>
  -play dolls<br>
  -drums, flutes, horns  and many other different musical instruments <br>
  -religious figures and  totems</p>
<p><strong>Cities of South Sudan</strong><br>
  <strong>Juba City</strong> <br>
  Juba is South Sudan&rsquo;s capital and one of Africa&rsquo;s  fastest growing cities. The money injected by the World Bank, the IMF and  petrol-related activities have transformed Juba&rsquo;s skyline. The story of Juba  starts in 1874 when the newly appointed Governor of Equatoria, famous British  explorer Charles Gordon, moved the army&nbsp;garrison to Rejaf (15km south of  Juba&rsquo;s airport), due to&nbsp;local tribes taking the Gondokoro Garrison's  cattle and the soldier's bouts of Malaria. The development of the city came in  1922 when a group of Greek traders actually settled there. Buildings of that  period can still be seen in Hai  Jallaba &lsquo;the Arab district´ in local language. We would start the historic walk  in Jubek State&rsquo;s Directorate of Forestry, near Jit Supermarket (owned by an  Indian family). In this compound we find interesting 1920s brick buildings from  the British period and the last remaining stilt wooden house, similar to the  one Charles Gordon lived with his wife in Gondokoro Island. From the Jubek  State&rsquo;s Directorate of Forestry compound we walk to the Plant Nursery, with  interesting examples of imported trees brought by the British to habituate to  the harsh Equatoria climate. The Plant Nursery is an authentic oasis in the  middle of Juba. Near this old garden we find an old but still active port that  links Juba with the rest of the country. The area is called Hai Gabat and it is  the original site of the Bari (local tribe) village Gordon encountered in 1874.  The area still preserves a mystic importance for the local Bari people where  they worship a set of stones known as Pita Stones. In front of this port you  find historical Gondokoro Island where you hardly find any evidence of the  Turkish and Anglo-Egyptian adobe forts. We leave the White Nile shores and  continue to Juba&rsquo;s oldest and still active Al Atiq mosque, built in 1939.  Around the mosque we find interesting examples of Greek-style architecture.  Ghines&rsquo; family house and the old Casino, now a commercial bank with its  original structure hidden behind a recently added cladding. George Ghines,  descendant of the pioneer Greek families owns Notos Restaurant in an old  colonial finely restored warehouse. After having lunch at Notos we end up Juba  historic walk in Hai Malakia quarter, where the city expanded after 1930 and  todays Juba oldest commercial area, with an interesting mixture of peoples from  all around the world. In Hai Malakia we find a nice Turkish restaurant,  Istambul, where one can enjoy one of the best mutabal (aubergine / eggplant  cream) one can ever taste and an excellent warm lentil-ginger soup. We also  find Konyo Konyo market, the busiest and biggest in Juba with many scarified Mundari  meat sellers wearing ivory bracelets. We will wrap up the day having dinner at  Da Vinci&rsquo;s restaurant on the banks of the White Nile with privileged views over  Juba Nile metal bridge. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Kapoeta Town</strong></p>
<p>Capital of Kapoeta State and main commercial centre in  south-eastern South Sudan. During the rains (April-October) Singaita River, at  the town&rsquo;s main entrance, can isolate Kapoeta from the rest of the country. The  post at Kapoeta was established by British Captain Knollys, who reached the  river in 1927. <br>
  The main road from Lokichogio, Kenya to the capital  city of Juba, South Sudan, runs through Kapoeta. The town is also served by  Kapoeta Airport, which is little more than a dirt strip. 10.000 people live in  the city, mainly of the Toposa tribe and Kenyan and Ugandan merchants. Kapoeta  is the ideal base to explore the tribal areas in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of South Sudan</strong><br>
  Last Places team is conscious of the great potential  of nature tourism in South Sudan. From the very moment we decided to open an  office in Juba we knew that besides tribal diversity the rich network of  National Parks would be one of the demands for travellers. Since 2012 we have  explored in depth several parks, probably the easiest ones to visit: Nimule,  near the Uganda border where it is possible to navigate with motor canoes the  White Nile and spot some elephants, Boma National Park, the largest one in the  country, bordering Ethiopia where Africa&rsquo;s second largest ungulate migration  takes place and Imatong Forest Reserve on the way to crown Mount Kinyeti (3.187  meters), South Sudan&rsquo;s highest peak. Here we saw some blue monkeys and many  birds… The rest of the parks are there to be explored and see what is left  after 50 years of Civil War. Most of them have almost no infrastructure and in  a way is what makes them more attractive for a certain type of adventurous  nature passionate. Last Places is able to organise visits all around South  Sudan including the Sudd, Africa&rsquo;s largest wetland and one of the World&rsquo;s most  virgin regions.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Boma National Park</strong><br>
  Boma National Park is South Sudan&rsquo;s largest protected  area after the Sudd wetland (not considered a National Park to this day). It encompasses  a vast area of 22.800 km2 in  eastern South Sudan, connecting with Ethiopia&rsquo;s Gambella National Park. The  landscape of this park features floodplains and grasslands. In South Sudan, as  in the Serengeti, the migration takes place all year, it is a slow movement  dependant on the grass and the rains. In March/April/May/June the animals are  moving from North to South and West to East, from the Sudd flood plains and  Bandingilo National Park,&nbsp;back into Boma National Park and Gambela Park in  Ethiopia, because the rains will have started. In November/December/January the  animals are moving from South to North and East to West&nbsp;as the dry season  is well under way and the animals are searching for grass. In  November/December/January the white-eared kob will be calving as they migrate  north into the Sudd flood plain and west into Bandigalo National Park.&nbsp;The  major migrating species involved are: white-eared Kob antelope, Tiang Antelope,and  Mongalla Gazelle. Prior to the the war with the north there were huge herds of  Zebra, these animals were considerable reduced in number.&nbsp;A 2008 survey  estimated that there were 6,850 Elephants in the park and surrounding area  adjacent to the park. The Elephants and Zebra&nbsp;also migrate with the water  and grass. Large mammals like the elephant, leopard, buffalo, Nubian giraffe,  Sudan cheetah, Grant's gazelle, white-eared kob, and East African lion inhabit  the national park. Some of the most notable birds of the park include the  black-chested snake eagle and the Ruppell's vulture. Boma National Park has the  greatest concentration of wildlife in the country, but unfortunately the  wildlife is threatened by hunting for bushmeat and commercial purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Bandingilo  National Park</strong><br>
  Bandingilo  National Park is located in South Sudan&rsquo;s Equatoria region near the White Nile  River. The park was established in 1992 and has an area of 10.000 km2. The park is famous for one of the  most spectacular natural phenomena of the world: the second largest migration  of multiple antelope species. Some of the antelope species involved in this  migration are the tiang, reedbuck, white-eared kob.<strong> In the start of the wet season April, May, the  herds are migrating into Bandingilo National Park from Boma National Park, stay  in the park June, July August and then start to migrate out in September and  October. The major animals that migrate in and out of the park, are white-eared  kob antelope, Tiang antelope, Mongalla&nbsp;gazelle and Elephant. The animals  congregate in this park during the European Summer vacation time, making it an  excellent time to see wildlife in South Sudan.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sudd  Wetland</strong><br>
  The Sudd wetland, with an estimated area of  approximately 57.000 km2&nbsp;represents the largest freshwater  ecosystem in Africa and one of the biggest in the world. <br>
  The extent of the Sudd wetlands is highly  variable; it depends largely on the seasons and years respectively. In the wet  season the size of the wetland increases up to 90.000 km² and gradually  decreases to about 42.000 km² depending on high seasonal flood. It is sustained  by the flow of the White Nile (or Bahr el Jebel) from Lake Victoria in Uganda,  in&nbsp;addition to rainfall runoff from its surrounding areas. </p>
<p>  The  Sudd is internationally recognised for its unique ecological attributes that  include various endangered mammalian species, antelope migrations, millions of  Palaearctic migratory birds and large fish populations. Notable wildlife  species include the African elephants, Nile lechwe endemic to South Sudan,  tiang migration, white-eared kob migration<em>,</em>&nbsp;buffalo, and bird species include the shoebill. The Sudd is an  important wintering ground for some of the migratory birds such as the Great  White Pelican, Black Crowned Crane, White Stork and Black Tern.It forms part of  the East-Asian/East African flyway of Palearctic birds, linking breeding ranges  in central-Europe and Asia with winter ranges to the south. A large number of  inter-African bird migrants also rely on the Sudd and surrounding habitats as a  dry season refuge.<br>
  The  Sudd has rich and abundant fish populations, a response to the favourable  environmental conditions for recruitment and survival offered by its mosaic of  habitat types. Key aquatic habitats range from open water and riverine to  lacustrine and palustrine, which offer ideal spawning, rearing, growing,  feeding and survival grounds for over a hundred species of fish. These habitats  are largely intact and largely unaffected by industrial development and  include; 31 Siluroids, 16 Characoids, 14 Cyprinoids, 11 Momyrids, 8 Cichlids,  and 7 Cyprinodonotids of fish communities. There are also eight endemic Nile  dwarf fish species found in the Sudd wetland, which are&nbsp;<em>Cromeria  nilotica, Nannaethiops unitaeniatus, Barbus stigmatopygus, Chelaethiops bibie,  Andersonia leptura, Aplocheilichthys loati, Epiplatys marnoi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Electris nanus</em>.</p>
<p>The  culture and society of the approximately 1 million people inhabiting the Sudd  wetland region are closely linked to its ecological functioning. The dominant  cultural affiliations in the Sudd are the tribes of Nuer, Dinka, Shilluk,  and Anyuak all of which are Nilotic and  pastoralists peoples indigenous to the Nile Valley. These groups have developed  traditions that have allowed them to adapt to the inundated and seasonally  variable conditions across the Sudd through a combination of nomadic  agro-pastoralism, non-timber forest product collection and fishing. Specific  practices include the seasonal construction of settlements on small islands in  flooded areas, and traditional hunting and fishing techniques. The hydrological  functions and patterns of the Sudd maintain the livelihoods and cultural  practices of the Sudd&rsquo;s tribes. &nbsp;The cultural groups living within the  Sudd region also maintain beliefs and practices that serve to support and conserve  the environment they live in. For example, the cultural beliefs of the Shilluk  community living within the Sudd region are an important aspect in the  preservation of the Nile lechwe (antelope species endemic to South Sudan) as  they consider killing of the animal species as taboo, and this of course helps  in their conservation and sustainable use. It is therefore valuable to support  many of the cultural practices of the communities living in the Sudd as these  are closely intertwined with the natural elements and preserving them also  creates and maintains an awareness of past and traditional knowledge in the  general public.<br>
  </p>
<p>Across the Sudd region, overexploitation of wildlife  and habitat fragmentation are notable threats, including commercial poaching  linked to small-arms availability, inadequate planning for returning displaced  peoples, competition for scarce natural resources (e.g. pasture and water),  road building without sufficient environmental planning, and the expansion of  the oil industry into ecologically sensitive areas (the Sudd contains South  Sudan's largest oil reserves), which result in habitat degradation from  infrastructure and pollution, as well as increased hunting and trafficking  activity. The Jonglei Canal Project that began in 1978 presented a significant  threat to the social, ecological and hydrological functioning of the Sudd. A  large channel was cut between Malakal southwest towards Bor, with the onset of  the 1983 Sudan civil war construction of the canal was cancelled. Today a  partially inundated channel remains, however, it had no documented negative  impact on the Sudd wetland ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Mount  Kinyeti</strong><br>
  The highest peak in all of South Sudan is called Mount Kinyeti at 3.187  meters and it is located within Imatong Forest Reserve that covers 1.032 km2 of l<strong>owland tropical forest</strong>. Rainfall  in the reserve is the highest in all of South Sudan measuring 2.261 mm  annually. Animals listed in the reserve are; Bushbuck, Blue Duiker, Colobus  Monkey, Blue Monkey, Leopard, and Hyena. It is estimated that over 500 species  of bird use the forest, many migrating between Europe and Kenya. The endangered  Spotted Ground Thrush is found in the reserve.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.travelosudan.com/destinations/kidepo-game-reserve/"><strong>Kidepo Game Reserve</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  The  Kidepo Game Reserve is located in the southernmost depths of South Sudan. Contiguous  with the famous Kidepo National Park in Uganda across the border, it&rsquo;s a sea of  greenery that extends for more than 1.200 km2 across the savannah grasslands and gallery woods  of the region.</p>
<p><strong>Lantoto  National Park</strong><br>
  Lantoto National Park is located on South Sudan&rsquo;s border with the  Democratic Republic of the Congo, connected to de la Garamba National Park. The  park encompasses an area of 760 km2,  which is covered by open glades and dense forests. These tropical forests are home to Africa's smallest and most  endangered elephants. Wild forest elephants (<em>Loxodonta  cyclotis</em>) have been  scientifically documented for the first time (2017) in&nbsp;South  Sudan researchers from Bucknell  University and Fauna &amp; Flora International. The researchers spotted the  critically endangered pachyderms, which are smaller than their more famous savannah  cousins, using camera traps set up in South Sudan's Western Equatoria state, a  region of densely forested hills near the borders of the Democratic Republic of  the Congo and the Central African Republic.<br>
  The elephants weren't the only surprise. A total  of 37 species appeared in the images, including four more species never before  documented in South Sudan: an elusive African golden cat, a water chevrotain  (sort of like a tiny deer), red river hogs and a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/mark-world-pangolin-day-new-video-about-quirky-creatures-180954367/">giant  pangolin</a>. The  cameras also picked up previously known South Sudanese species, such as  chimpanzees, leopards, forest buffalo, bongo antelope and honey badgers. Such a  cornucopia is the product of Western Equatoria's unique position in South  Sudan, where the Congo Basin meets the flat savannahs of the Horn of Africa.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Nimule  National Park</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  South  Sudan's Nimule National Park is the easiest park to visit in South Sudan, due  to its infrastructure and proximity to Juba.  The 410 km2   park  is crossed by the White Nile. The park has a small population of elephants. </p>
<p><strong>Shambe  National Park</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  Shambe  National Park was founded in 1985 and covers an area of 620 km2. It is located on the western banks  of the White Nile River in the remote area of Adior. The park used to be rich  in wildlife which included hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, lions, ostriches,  giraffes, and monkeys. After 50 years of Civil War most species have  disappeared. A survey, as in most parks in South Sudan is needed. Shambe  National Park has a big potential as bird watching destination for its hundreds  of resident and migratory bird species.</p>
<p><strong>Southern  National Park</strong><br>
  Southern  National Park occupies an area of 23.000 km2.  Three rivers drain the park. The park hosts a variety of habitats like gallery  forests, rainforests, bushveld, and grasslands. Several species of fish, like  the catfish, lung fish, and tilapia are found in the park's rivers. Crocodiles  can be also be found in the park's waters. The mammalian fauna of Southern  National Park features the colobus monkey, Congo lion, Kordofan giraffe,  African buffalo, giant eland, and kob.</p>
<p><strong>SOUTH SUDAN ACCOMMODATION</strong><br>
  Accommodation in South  Sudan is quite limited out of Juba. Being a new country (2011) with limited  commercial activity and with almost no tourism explains why no investors have  decided to build hotels around the country, out of Juba city. Last Places  offers the best lodging possibilities in towns like Torit and Juba and  organises comfortable tented camps with cook services during the visits to  remote tribal areas and national parks.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Accommodation in Juba</strong><br>
  In South Sudan&rsquo;s  capital we have many options and every year there are more hotels. In Last  Places we like hotels not far from the Nile due to the relative freshness that  comes from the river. Also because they are near the international airport and  not far from Juba&rsquo;s main interest points.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Accommodation in Torit</strong><br>
  Torit town lies in  between Juba and Kapoeta. If your trip in South Sudan is by road you are most  likely to spend one night or two in Torit. The options are not massive but  there a couple of hotels with air conditioning and en-suite toilet and shower.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Accommodation in Kapoeta</strong><br>
  <strong>Mango Camp</strong> is the best option in the region. It is an oasis of  nature and peace near Kapoeta town centre (walking distance)<br>
  Out of Kapoeta town we  find rare examples of accommodation. <strong>Kuron  Catholic Mission</strong> would be one of them. Ideal as a stop on the way from Boma</p>
<p><strong>SOUTH SUDAN TRAVEL INFORMATION</strong><br>
  <strong>South Sudan Visa</strong><br>
  A valid  passport and a visa are required for travel to South Sudan. Applications for  visas can be made in advance in the travelers&rsquo; home country or in the nearest  South Sudan Embassy: London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Rome, Oslo, Geneva,  Moscow, Washington, New York, Tel Aviv, Ankara, Beijing, New Delhi, and  Pretoria. There is also the possibility of obtaining the Visa upon arrival.  <strong>Last  Places</strong> assists all travelers that need any type of help applying for the  visa upon arrival or at the embassy. We recommend that passports be valid for  six months from date of arrival. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Vaccines and Travel Health in South Sudan</strong><br>
  A valid <strong>yellow fever vaccination</strong> certificate is  essential for entry to South Sudan. Malaria is prevalent in the country. It is  wise to take <strong>Malaria prophylaxis</strong> when travelling through South Sudan. Water supply is unsafe to drink, visitors  should drink bottle water. Visitors should also avoid eating unpeeled, unwashed  fruit and vegetables. The milk in South Sudan is unpasteurized and should be  boiled; alternatively use tinned milk reconstituted with bottle water. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Security in South Sudan</strong><br>
  Last Places opened an office in Juba, South Sudan in  2015 during the conflict between Dinka and Nuer tribes. The area affected by  this civil conflict was near the Sudan border, far from the areas we visit. A  Peace Agreement has been signed in May 2019 between the Dinka and the Nuer, we  hope it lasts long but are also conscious that this part of Africa has never  seen complete calmness. We spoke before in this site about the history of what  was known as Equatoria, a tribal land where cattle pastoralist tribes have an  essential feuding culture. Cattle, water, grazing lands, honour, and tribal  affiliation…mixed with petrol and Globalization make almost impossible the  state of complete peace. The essence of South Sudan is precisely its  ethnographic reality. In Last Places we visit tribal people we have been  working with for the last 7 years, that we support (water, food, and cultural  revival projects) and that we know they are in conflict with other groups. It  also happens in Southern Ethiopia&rsquo;s touristic Omo Valley, in tourist areas of  Northern Uganda and Kenya... it is a social, political, cultural and economic  reality of Africa&rsquo;s pastoralist societies. Said all this, Last Places is  permanently monitoring the socio-political situation of this nation we are  passionate for and we avoid any risks when we organise the trips with clients  all around the country. Having an office in Juba and knowing many people in the  country facilitates this monitoring and having first hand objective  information.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>When to go to South Sudan</strong><br>
  Travelers can visit South Sudan all year around. Last Places offers  trips to South Sudan all year around. Said this, dry season –from mid-November  to mid-April - allows the traveller visit all tribal areas while whet season –  from June to October- may limit the visit to certain remote regions such as  Boma Plateau. <br>
  </p>
