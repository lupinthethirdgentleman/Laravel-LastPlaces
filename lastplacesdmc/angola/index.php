					<h1>ANGOLA DMC</h1>
					<p class="text-center">Last Places Angola is one of the first DMCs to operate in Angola since the country opened to tourism in 2012. Last Places Angola has been operating in Angola since 2014 offering tailor made trips to travel agencies from all around the World. Most of these trips are focused in Angola’s main highlights: tribal groups, nature and colonial heritage.</p>

					<h3>Why Angola?</h3>
					<p style="margin-top: 20px;">Situated in Central Africa, west of Zambia and north of Namibia, Angola is slowly realizing its potential as a tourist hotspot, after decades of civil war following independence from Portugal in 1975.</p>
					<p>Africa’s most untouched tribes, virgin ecosystems, unique cultural heritage, a stunning coastline strung with beautiful sandy beaches, and a mountainous interior that gives way to deep gorges and tumbling waterfalls, Angola offers a wide array of opportunities for tourism to its visitors. Cultural diversity and natural beauty aside, the country also boasts a rich gastronomy (fusion between African, Portuguese and Brazilian cuisines) with delicious culinary specialties and a people that are known for their hospitality and friendliness.</p>
					<p>As Angola is opening up to the rest of the world, more and more people are taking advantage of the wonderful landscapes and unique tribal groups. To get the most out of your trip, book with Last Places Angola. We have been operating since 2014 and have pioneered the spots along the whole of Angola. We are constantly adapting our styles to assist our guests in having the best possible travel experience in Angola.</p>

					<h3>Tribes of Angola</h3>
					<p style="margin-top: 20px;">Tribes in Angola are mainly concentrated in 3 provinces of Southwest Angola: Huila, Namibe and Cunene. The main reason why they have been able to preserve most of their traditional lifestyle and aesthetic looks it is because of their nomadic or semi-nomadic type of life. Another factor would be that they live in a dry ecosystem where European colonization did not develop extensively as in other parts of Angola. Nganguela and Kwanyama are located in Southeast region and are more westernized than other tribes but still keep tribal social structure and dances. It is the same case in Chokwe tribe, despite modernity masquerades are still alive.</p>

				  <h2>Mumuila </h2>
					<p><strong>Also known as Muila or Mwila</strong></p>
					<h4>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</h4>
					<p>100.000 Mumuila live in Huila Plateau.  Last Places team of ethnographers has divided the Mumuila tribe in Plain  Mumuila (East of Chibia town) and Mountain Mumuila (West of Chibia town). They  speak the same Nyaneka language with slight dialect differences but women dress  differently with Plain Mumuila more richly decorated (hair and necks). </p>
				  <h4>Economy  &amp; Society</h4>
					<p>Subsistence agriculture (mostly maize) and  livestock keeping (cattle, goats and fowl). They gather in daily markets  (except Sundays and Mondays) to sell and buy agriculture, artisan, and  manufactured products. Some few Mumuila women still produce fine pottery to  sell in markets.<br>
					Mumuila have a tribal chief who serves as  the head of the tribe followed by a headman. Serving under the headman are the  elders. Conflicts are resolved by the elders and the headman. A diviner is also  often called upon.</p>
					<h4>Culture  &amp; Religion</h4>
					<p><strong>Mumuila speak Nyaneka language.</strong></p>
				  <p>For Mumuila women hairstyle is very  important and meaningful. Mumuila women coat their hair with a red paste called  oncula which is made of crushed red stone. They also put a mix of oil, crushed  tree bark, dried cow dung and herbs on their hair. Besides they decorate their hair  with beads, metal objects, cauri shells and even dried food.<br>
					Having their forehead shaved is considered  a sign of beauty. The dreadlocks, are called nontombi. The number of big  dreadlocks has a meaning: 3 dreadlocks means there is a dead person in the family.  4 to 6 dreadlocks is the normal style. </p>
					
					<p>Mumuila women also wear impressive  necklaces. Each type of necklace corresponds to a specific period of their  life. When they are young, girls wear heavy red necklaces, made with beads  covered with a mix of soil and latex. Later girls start to wear a set of yellow  necklaces called vikeka made of wicker covered with earth. They keep it around  4 years until their wedding. Once married they start to wear a set of stacked  up bead necklaces, called vilanda. Mumuila women never take their necklace off  and have to sleep with it. They use wooden headrests, some beautifully carved,  to protect their hairstyles. <br><br>
					Mumuila people are increasingly adopting  the Christian religion but the older generations and in remote mountain  villages Mumuila Animistic religion is still practiced. Mumuila believe that  the spirits of their ancestors can either work for their good of for their  worst. In order to please the ancestors, animal sacrifices have to be made. At  birth a child is dedicated to a spirit by the parents in order to bless and  protect him.</p>
                  <p><strong>Handa</strong><br>
				  Also known as Handa de Quipungo or Vahanda<strong></strong><br>
                  <strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
				  30.000 Handa live in the fertile plains of  Huila Plateau, between Kamuviu and Hoque market towns.<br>
                  <strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
				  Handa people mainly practice subsistence  agriculture but also grow vegetables (cabbage and onions) to sell in big  markets like in Hoque. Hand farmers also keep cattle, goats and fowl. Handa  blacksmiths, once very active, are nowadays in regression but some still work  to furnish Handa women with jewellery and hoes for the farm work. Potters are  also in decay but some Handa women still fabricate clay pots to sell in  markets.<br>
				  Handa  women continue to build and use baskets which involve many interesting geometry  concepts. We refer, for example, to the notion of volume, conic (truncated) and  cylindrical forms, spirals, proportions, geometric figures, patterns, plane  transformations and friezes. The remarkable mathematical practices in the  baskets are characterized by much unknown ethnomathematical knowledge that  constitutes a challenge for future studies. <br>
				  Handa have a tribal chief who serves as  the head of the tribe followed by a headman. Serving under the headman are the  elders. Conflicts are resolved by the elders and the headman. A diviner is also  often called upon.</p>
                  <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
				  Handa speak Nyaneka language. <br>
				  Most Handa have converted to Christianity  and only the elder generations worship the African Gods and wear the  traditional attires. Nowadays it is hard to see women younger the forty years  old wearing the white (sometimes green) characteristic necklaces and complex  hairdos. Body scarification used to be popular among Handa women but now has  almost disappeared. Body marks can only be seen in women over fifty years old. 
                  </p>
                    <p><strong>Muhumbi</strong><br>
                      Also known as Humbi, Nkumbi, Khumbi, Ngumbi, Nkhumbi, Ocinkumbi<br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
                      150.000 Muhumbi people live the fertile  plains around Cunene River between the towns of Humbe and Xangongo.<br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
                      Muhumbi are mainly cattle herders but also  practice commercial and subsistence agriculture along the Cunene River. Many  young men leave the villages to find jobs in towns and cities. <br>
                      Muhumbi have a tribal chief who serves as  the head of the tribe followed by a headman. Serving under the headman are the  elders. Conflicts are resolved by the elders and the headman. A diviner is also  often called upon.<br>
  </p>
                  <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      Muhumbi speak Nyaneka language. Most Muhumbi  have converted to Christianity and only the elder generations worship the  African Gods. The most stunning aspect of visual Muhumbi culture are the  complex hairdos practiced to young women undergoing &lsquo;fico&rsquo; or rite of passage  (13-16 years old). There are two existing styles; the &lsquo;elephant ears&rsquo; style and  the crest style.</p>
                  <p><strong>Mugambue</strong><br>
                    Also known as Gambue or Gambo<br>
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
                    25.000 Mugambue live in the feet of small  rocky hills of Huila Plateau and in the forested plains south of Chibia.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
                    Mugambue people are cattle herders and  also practice subsistence agriculture. Hunting is still practiced in forested  areas. Mugambue blacksmiths have disappeared and now they purchase their hoes  and machetes from neighbouring Khoisan blacksmiths or they purchase them in  markets. Mugambue women still build and use wicker  baskets and granaries. Mugambue society is ruled by a tribal chief who serves  as the head of the clan followed by a headman. Serving under the headman are  the elders. Conflicts are resolved by the elders and the headman. A diviner is  also often called upon. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                    Mugambue speak Nyaneka language.<strong></strong><br>
                    Mugambue combine their traditional  religion related to the bull worshiping with Christianity. Nowadays only the  elder generations wear the traditional attires with the exception of remote  Mugambue groups in Cunene Province where one can find younger women with the  clay traditional hairdo. <br>
                    For traditional Mugambue women hairstyle  is very important and meaningful. Mugambue women coat their hair with a mustard  colour paste made of crushed yellowish stone, mixed with cow dung and herbs.  Besides they decorate their hair with beads.<br>
                  Mugambue women (mainly older women) also  wear impressive necklaces (not as impressive as neighbouring Mumuila or Handa  women&rsquo;s ones). Once married they start to wear a set of stacked up bead  necklaces, called vilanda. Mugambue women never take their necklace off and  have to sleep with it. They use wooden headrests, some beautifully carved, to  protect their hairstyles. </p>
                    <p><strong>Khoisan</strong><br>
                      Also known as  Khoi, San, Juǀʼhoansi, !Kung, Ekoka !Kung,<strong> </strong>Kamusekele,  Sekele, or Mucancala <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
                      3.000 Khoisan from Ekoka clan live in the  rocky forested hills of Huila Plateau and around 5.000 &lsquo;swamp&rsquo; Khoisan live in  the large swampy area of Kwando Kuvango (Zambia and Namibia, Botswana borders).<br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
                      In  Khoisan society men and women live together in a non-exploitative manner,  displaying a striking degree of equality between the sexes.&nbsp;This band  level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence  into the 1970s. Today, the great majority of Khoisan people live semi-sedentary  lives near the villages of Bantu pastoralists. <br>
                      Traditionally,  especially among&nbsp;Khoisan women generally collect plant foods and water,  providing 60% - 80% of the group's sustenance, while men hunt. However, these  gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no  shame. <br>
                      Women generally  take care of children and prepare food. However, this does restrict them to  their homes, since these activities are generally done with, or close to,  others, so women can socialise and help each other. Men are also engaged in  these activities. <br>
                      Children are  raised in village groups of other children of a wide age range. Sexual  activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes. <br>
                      Khoisan women  often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing  their lives, enjoying each other's company and children. Khoisan women will  often rest, talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia" title="Adansonia">baobab tree</a>. This illustrates &quot;collective  mothering&quot;, where several women support each other and share the nurturing  role <br>
                      It  is unusual for the Khoisan to have a chieftain or headman in a position of  power over the other members. Chieftainship within the Khoisan is not a  position with the greatest power, as they have the same social status as the  elders. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal, though there are some  responsibilities the chieftain assumes, such as becoming the tribe's logical  head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters' kills;  these leaders do not receive a larger portion than any other member of the  village<strong> </strong><br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      <strong>Khoisan speak !Kung language. </strong><br>
                  Khoisan  people call themselves the Juǀʼhoansi. Their material culture is very basic  since they are nomadic or semi-nomadic and cannot carry many things. Today,  they use colour beads to decorate their hairs and necks and have abandoned  animal skins to cover their bodies. Since the 1960s Khoisan people use cotton  fabrics as clothes, given by Bantu neighbours in exchange of medicinal plants  Khoisan collect in the bush and in exchange of manual work in the fields Bantus  possess. Khoisan still fabricate sophisticated bows and arrows for  hunting.  <br>
                      Khoisan people&nbsp;recognize  a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Being" title="Supreme Being">Supreme Being</a>&nbsp;(Khu/Xu/Xuba/Huwa) who is the Creator  and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods, he also punishes  man by means of the weather, and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob, who  &quot;knows everything&quot;. <br>
                      Khoisan  practice&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism" title="Shamanism">shamanism</a>&nbsp;to communicate with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit" title="Spirit">spirit</a>&nbsp;world, and to cure what they call &quot;Star  Sickness&quot;. The communication with the spirit world is done by a natural  healer entering a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness" title="Altered state of consciousness">trance  state</a>&nbsp;and running  through a fire, thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured  by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laying_on_of_hands" title="Laying on of hands">laying hands</a>&nbsp;on the diseased. <br>
                      Healing rituals  are a primary part of the Khoisan culture. In the Khoisan state of mind having  health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within  the tribe are stable and open between other people in the tribe. Any member of  the Khoisan tribe can become a healer because it &quot;is a status accessible  to all,&quot; but it is a grand aspiration of many members because of its  importance.&nbsp;Even though there is no restriction of the power, &quot;nearly  half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to  heal,&quot; but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To  become a healer, aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older  healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into a trance to  teach the novices, rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils&rsquo; centres — their  bellies, backs, foreheads, and spines. <br>
                  The community of  the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have  trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and  spiritually through life. The ǃKung have a saying: &quot;Healing makes their  hearts happy, and a happy heart is one that reflects a sense of  community.&quot; Because of their longing to keep the peace between people, their  community is tranquil. </p>
                    <p><strong>Mudimba</strong><br>
                      <strong>Also known as Dimba</strong><br>

                    <p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
                      15.000 Mudimba live between the wooded  savannah eat of Cahama and the dry and rocky valleys and hills that end in  Cunene River.<strong></strong><br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
                      Mudimba people are cattle herders and also  practice hunting and subsistence agriculture. Mudimba  women continue to build and use baskets which involve many interesting geometry  concepts. <br>
  </p>
                  <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      Dimba speak Herero language. <br>
                  Dimba married women have two different styles of  hairdo; &lsquo;Afro&rsquo; style normally seen in older women or mothers with babies and  the &lsquo;three crest&rsquo; style less impressive than the &lsquo;afro&rsquo; style. Dimba girls wear  beaded wigs (sometimes covering their faces) for wedding celebrations which  means they have had their first periods but are not ready for marriage. Dimba  are becoming influenced by neighbouring Mhumbi and Mugambue tribes and are  becoming increasingly Christians. Despite this tendency, in small villages  African religion is still widely practiced. </p>
                    <p><strong>Himba</strong><br>

                      18.000 Himba live in Angola and 7.000 in  Namibia, separated by the Cunene River. They live in the dry and rocky valleys  and hills around the Cunene River.<br>

                      Himba  people are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy" title="Polygamy">polygamous</a>, with the average Himba  man being husband to two wives at the same time. They also practice early&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage" title="Arranged marriage">arranged marriages</a>. Young Himba girls are  married to male partners chosen by their fathers. This happens from the onset  of puberty which may mean that girls aged 10 or below are married  off.&nbsp;Among the Himba people, it is customary as a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage" title="Rite of passage">rite of passage</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision" title="Circumcision">circumcise</a>&nbsp;boys before puberty.  Upon marriage, a Himba boy is considered a man, unlike a Himba girl who is not  considered a fully-fledged woman until she bears a child. Marriage with the  Himba involves transactions between cattle, which is the source of their  economy. Bride wealth is involved in these transactions; this can be negotiable  between the groom's family and the bride's father, depending on the poverty  status between the families involved. In order for the bride's family to accept  the bride wealth, the cattle must appear of high quality. It is standard  practice to offer an ox, but more cattle will be offered if the groom's father  is wealthy and is capable of offering more. <br>
                      Himba people live  under a tribal structure based on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_descent" title="Bilateral descent">bilateral descent</a>&nbsp;that helps them live in one of the  most extreme environments on earth. <br>
                      Under bilateral  descent, every tribe member belongs to two clans: one through the father (a  patriclan, called&nbsp;<em>oruzo</em>) and another through the mother (a  matriclan, called&nbsp;<em>eanda</em>).&nbsp;Himba clans are led by the eldest  male in the clan. Sons live with their father's clan, and when daughters marry,  they go to live with the clan of their husband. However, inheritance of wealth  does not follow the patriclan but is determined by the matriclan, that is, a  son does not inherit his father's cattle but his maternal uncle's instead. <br>

                    <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      Himba speak Herero language. <br>
                      Both the Himba  men and women are accustomed to wearing traditional clothing that befits their  living environment and the hot&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate" title="Semi-arid climate">semi-arid climate</a>&nbsp;of their area, in most occurrences  this consists simply of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirt" title="Skirt">skirt</a>-like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing" title="Clothing">clothing</a>&nbsp;made from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calfskin" title="Calfskin">calfskins</a>&nbsp;and sheep skin or increasingly from more modern  textiles, and occasionally&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandal" title="Sandal">sandals</a>&nbsp;for footwear. Women&rsquo;s sandals are  made from cows' skin while men's is made from old car tires. Himba women  especially, as well as Himba men, are remarkably famous for covering themselves  with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otjize" title="Otjize">otjize</a></em>&nbsp;paste, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics" title="Cosmetics">cosmetic</a>&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfat" title="Butterfat">butterfat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochre" title="Ochre">ochre</a>&nbsp;pigment, to cleanse the skin over long periods  due to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity" title="Water scarcity">water scarcity</a>&nbsp;and protect themselves from the  extremely hot and dry climate of Cunene River region&nbsp;as well as  against&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquito</a>&nbsp;insect bites. The cosmetic mixture, often  perfumed with the aromatic resin of the&nbsp;<em>omuzumba</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrub</a>, gives their skin and hair&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid" title="Braid">plaits</a>&nbsp;a distinctive orange or red-tinge  characteristic, as well as texture and style.&nbsp;Otjize is considered  foremost a highly desirable&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetic</a>&nbsp;beauty cosmetic, symbolizing earth's  rich red colour and blood the essence of life, and is consistent with the Himba  ideal of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty" title="Beauty">beauty</a>. <br>
                  Hairstyle and  jewellery play a significant role among the Himba, it indicates age and social  status within their community. An infant or child will generally have his head  kept shaven of hair or a small crop of hair on his head crown, this soon is  sculptured to one braided hair plait extended to the rear of the head for young  boys and young girls have two braided hair plaits extended forward towards the  face often parallel to their eyes, the form of wear being determined by  the&nbsp;<em>oruzo</em>&nbsp;membership (patrilineal descent group), the style  remains during&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preadolescence" title="Preadolescence">preadolescence</a>&nbsp;until reaching&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty" title="Puberty">puberty</a>.&nbsp;Some young girls, with exception, may also have  one braided hair plait extended forwards, which means they are one of a pair  of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin" title="Twin">twins</a>. </p>
                    <p>                      From pubescence,  boys continue to have one braided hair plait, girls will have many&nbsp;<em>otjize</em>&nbsp;textured  hair plaits, some arranged to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil" title="Veil">veil</a>&nbsp;the girl's face, in daily practice  the hair plaits are often tied together and held parted back from the  face.&nbsp;Women who have been married for about a year, or have had a child,  wear an ornate headpiece called the&nbsp;<em>Erembe</em>, sculptured from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepskin" title="Sheepskin">sheepskin</a>, with many streams of braided hair,  coloured and put in shape with otjize paste.&nbsp;Unmarried young men continue  to wear one braided hair plait extended to the rear of the head, while married  men wear a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap" title="Cap">cap</a>&nbsp;or head-wrap and un-braided hair beneath. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow" title="Widow">Widowed</a>&nbsp;men will remove their cap or head-wrap and  expose un-braided hair. The Himba are also accustomed to use&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_ash" title="Wood ash">wood ash</a>&nbsp;for hair cleansing due to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity" title="Water scarcity">water scarcity</a> <br>
                      Himba people are  a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism" title="Monotheism">monotheistic</a>&nbsp;people who worship the God&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukuru" title="Mukuru">Mukuru</a>, as well as their clan's ancestors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration_of_the_dead" title="Veneration of the dead">ancestor  reverence</a>). Mukuru only  blesses, while the ancestors can bless and curse. Each family has its own&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_worship" title="Fire worship">sacred ancestral fire</a>, which is kept by the fire-keeper. The  fire-keeper approaches the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred" title="Sacred">sacred</a>&nbsp;ancestral fire every seven to eight  days in order to communicate with Mukuru and the ancestors on behalf of his  family.&nbsp;Often, because Mukuru is busy in a distant realm, the ancestors  act as Mukuru's representatives. <br>
                  The Himba  traditionally believe in&nbsp;<em>omiti</em>, which some translate to mean&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a>&nbsp;but which others call &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_magic" title="Black magic">black magic</a>&quot; or &quot;bad medicine&quot;.&nbsp;Some  Himba believe that death is caused by&nbsp;<em>omiti</em>, or rather, by someone  using&nbsp;<em>omiti</em>&nbsp;for malicious purposes.&nbsp;Additionally, some  believe that evil people who use&nbsp;<em>omiti</em>&nbsp;have the power to place  bad thoughts into another's mind or cause extraordinary events to  happen (such as when a common illness becomes life-threatening).&nbsp;But users  of&nbsp;<em>omiti</em>&nbsp;do not always attack their victim directly; sometimes  they target a relative or loved one. Some OvaHimba will consult a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_healers_of_South_Africa" title="Traditional healers of South Africa">traditional  African diviner-healer</a>&nbsp;to  reveal the reason behind an extraordinary event, or the source of the&nbsp;<em>omiti</em>. </p>
                    <h3>Himba Color perception </h3>
                  <p>Several researchers  have studied the Himba perception of colours. The Himba use four  colour names:&nbsp;<em>zuzu</em>&nbsp;stands for dark shades of blue, red, green  and purple;&nbsp;<em>vapa</em>&nbsp;is white and some shades of yellow;&nbsp;<em>buru</em>&nbsp;is  some shades of green and blue; and&nbsp;<em>dambu</em>&nbsp;is some other shades  of green, red and brown. </p>

                    Muhakaona speak Herero language, similar  to Himba. In fact Muhakaona are also known as the Black Himba.<br>
                    Muhakaona women shape  their hairdo with a mix of cow dung, fat, and herbs (frangance). On top of  their hair some women may wear Kapapo headdress made of waste materials. Little girls have two braids on their foreheads,  little boys have one behind their head, but if you see a child with one single  braid on their forehead, it means that they are one of a set of twins.  Pubescent girls wear long dreadlocks, made from their own hair but also their  brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; hair.&rsquo; Near the towns, merchants have detected the  demand, and sell hair extensions from India. Muhakaona women cover their bodies  in otijze, a mixture of ash, butter and ochre that gives them the unique black-copper  colour. Also a beauty symbol, Muhacaona women remove their lower teeth, which is done by hitting them  with a stone. Like Himba men,  married Muhakaona men wrap their hair  in a sort of bandana and protect it by sleeping on a wooden pillow, often  covered in a leather cushion, rare sign of comfort for a tribe. </p>

                      70.000 Mucubal live in a large area  between the slopes of Chela Mounts in the north, Chiange to east, and Cunene  River to the south, where they are believed to have stopped during the Himba  migration in the 18th Century.<br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
                      Semi-nomadic cattle pastoralists. They  often steal cattle from Mugambue and Mumuila neighbouring tribes. Agriculture  was introduced in 1990s and is still very rudimentary. Mucubal where the last  tribe to be submitted by the Portuguese colonial army at it was not until 1939  that the last Mucubal leader accepted defeat. To this day they continue to be a  proud indomitable tribe.<br>
                      Family structure and organization are very  specific. The father has the authority and is the head of the family, although  the matrilineal descent is considered more important, as they inherit through  the mother's family. For example the son of the Soba -chieftain of the  village-&rsquo;s sister is the heir of the Soba.<br>
                      Mucubal can only get married with an  outsider of the clan, although it cannot be with a member of another tribe like  a Himba for example. Marriages of convenience are the rule most of the time.  The fiancée is presented to her future husband during the Fico ceremony, when  she is fourteen or less. This ceremony consists in a party with the two  families during which presents are offered.<br>
                      The couple has to wait a few more years  before consummating the marriage in the centre of the village. Mucubal men can  have several wives and are also allowed to sell their wife, if they don&rsquo;t get  along with her or even if they want to earn money, as a woman can be worth 2  cows, which is about 2000 euros. For a first marriage a woman can even be worth  3 or 4 cows.<br>
                  Cattle is the real base of support to this  important ethnic group in Angola. A Mucubal man is both richer and more important  per the number of cattle they have. It can therefore be said that the cattle  for any Mucubal is the ultimate expression of their wealth.</p>
                    <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      Mucubal speak Herero language.<strong></strong><br>
                      Mucubal women wear an original and unique  headdress called the Ompota. It is made of a wicker framework, traditionally  filled with a bunch of tied cow tails, decorated with buttons, shells, zippers  and beads. But tradition is disappearing as some women use Barbie dolls boxes  to cram their ompota headdress. Women whether they are married or not can wear  jewels. Ornaments like iron anklets, called Othivela, and armlets, called  Othingo, are worn by girls as well as adult women. Mucubal women are also  famous for the string they have around their breast, called oyonduthi, which is  used as a bra. Women use to smoke tobacco (that they keep in a snuffbox called  boceta) in pipes called opessi.<br>
                      At their younger age, Mucubal girls have  their upper teeth sharpened and lower ones removed. Also as mode of  beautification Mucubal women rub mupeque oil (reddish oil that comes from a  crushed nut found in the desert) on their necks and bodies.<br>
                      Mucubal have some very strong  time-honoured customs and traditions which they value so dearly. They are  seriously interested in cattle, worship it and do not care about the rest of  the world outside of the bush. As a custom, the Mucubals are not allowed to  mention people&rsquo;s name in public, except their parent&rsquo;s names and specifically  names of children. Married couples are not allowed to talk to each other in  public, as long as she (a wife) hasn&rsquo;t had children. They can only speak to  each other in private.<br>
                      Mucubal people believe in a God called  Huku, Klaunga, Ndyambi. They also worship their ancestors' spirits called Oyo  Handi and Ovi huku, which are considered inferior to their supreme divinity.<br>
                      Divination is very important in their  culture. They use talismans and amulets to protect their herds or prevent  adultery. Nevertheless Mucubal are not afraid of death. Funerals can last  several days or weeks. They decorate their graves with cattle horns.<br>
                      The number of cows sacrificed are in  relation with the importance of the deceased. This shows the importance of  cattle in their culture. Cattle is only killed on special occasions, as Mucubal  usually don&rsquo;t eat meat but rather corn (when they manage to grow some), eggs,  milk and chicken.<br>
                      They don&rsquo;t eat any fish because according  to the legend, one of their chieftains was brought to the sea by the Portuguese  and never came back. So they think that fish kills men.<br>
                  Like the vast majority of African peoples,  the Mucubals also practice a tradition strongly rooted circumcision of young  people. The ceremony of circumcision is performed regularly and is an event of  great significance, it being the feast of the initiation of young Mucubals, a  sort of passage of young people to the status of youths.</p>

                      The  culture and physical appearance of some of the Mucuis people seem to be a  remnant of a pre-Bantu indigenous population. Culturally they have been  strongly influenced by the Mucubal tribe, and speak the Mucubal dialect  of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_language" title="Herero language">Herero</a>. The last speakers of Mucuis passed away  in 1960s.<strong></strong><br>
                      Physically  speaking they are similar to other former hunter-gatherer groups, such as  Pre-Bantu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwadi_people" title="Kwadi people">Kwadi</a> and Tjimba. </p>
                    <p><strong>Ngendelengo</strong><br>

                      Semi-nomadic cattle pastoralists, hunter,  gatherers and subsistence agriculturalists. Living in a forested environment  has allowed them to develop a rudimentary charcoal business. Nguendelengo produce  important quantities of vegetable charcoal that they sell beside the roads that  cross their territory.<br>
  </p>
                  <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      Nguendelengo speak Herero language  strongly influenced by neighbouring Nyaneka. <br>
                  Nguendelengo  people typically wear little clothing (similar to Mucubal tribe), carry&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete" title="Machete">machetes</a>&nbsp;or spears, and are  renowned for their endurance, sometimes running 80&nbsp;km in a day. What is  unique about Nguendelengo culture is the way women decorate their hairs with  &lsquo;geisha-style&rsquo; buns and also their two-storey granary-homes. Nguendelengo live  in isolated mountain areas and have been little affected by Portuguese  colonization and missionary activity, therefore they still practice their African  religion related to bull worshiping. </p>

                  Culture is similar to neighbouring Mucubal  tribe but more Westernized due to proximity of Benguela area that was colonized  in the 18th century. Schooling and missionary action have affected  the traditional ways of Kwandu people and nowadays they are mostly  Christianised. </p>

                    <p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
                      Cuepe  used to be hunters and gatherers living along the Atlantic Coast and the desert  rivers. Like the Mucuis they were mainly fishermen, on the lower reaches of  the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroca_River" title="Coroca River">Curoca River</a>. With the arrival of  European settlers, Cuepe moved to more remote areas inside the desert. Today  they combine some symbolic hunting with gathering, subsistence agriculture, and  goat riering. <br>

The  last speakers of Cuepe language passed away in 2018. Cuepe culture is highly  influenced by dominant Mucubal culture. Despite this assimilation process and  the penetration of Christianity in the community there is a strong sense of  identity. Cuepe still practice traditional medicine that is related to the old  African religion (Animistic). Cuepe fabricate dolls and are in an interesting  process of cultural revival, decidedly supported by Last Places.<strong> </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Kwanyama</strong><br>
                      Also known as Cuanhama, Humba, Kuanjama,  Kwancama, Kwanjama, Kwanyama, Ochikwanyama, Oshikuanjama, Oshikwanyama, Ovambo,  Oxikuanyama, or Wambo. <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
                      400.000 Kwanyama reside in the flat sandy grassy plains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunene_Province" title="Cunene Province">Cunene Province</a>, sometimes referred to as  Ovamboland. These plains are generally flat, stoneless and at high altitude. Water  courses, known as&nbsp;<em>oshanas</em>, irrigate the area. In the northern  regions of Ovamboland is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics" title="Tropics">tropical</a>&nbsp;vegetation sustained  by abundant but seasonal rainfall that floods the region into temporary lakes  and islands. In dry season, these pools of water empty out. <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Economy &amp; Society</strong><strong> </strong><br>
                      Kwanyama people  lead a settled life, relying mostly on a combination of agriculture and animal  husbandry. The staple crops have been millet, sorghum, and beans. In drier  regions or seasons, pastoral activity with herds of cattle, goats and sheep becomes  more important. The animal husbandry is not for meat, but primarily as a source  of milk. Their food is supplemented by hunting, fishing, and gathering. <br>
                      During the  colonial era, the Kwanyama people were active in elephant hunting for their  tusks to supply the ivory demand, and they nearly hunted the elephants in their  region to extinction. <br>
                      Kwanyama  are skilled craftsmen. They make and sell basketry,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery" title="Pottery">pottery</a>, jewellery, wooden combs,  wood iron spears, arrows, richly decorated daggers, musical instruments, and  also ivory buttons. <br>
                      Each  Kwanyama clan has a hereditary&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief" title="Tribal chief">chief</a>&nbsp;who is responsible  for the clan. Many clans have adapted representation by having a council of  headmen who run tribal affairs. Members of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family" title="Royal family">royal family</a>&nbsp;of the Owamboland  are known as&nbsp;<em>ovakwaluvala</em>.  Only those who belong to this family by birth, through the maternal  line, have a claim to chieftainship. The clans figure their descent by a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineal" title="Matrilineal">matrilineal</a>&nbsp;kinship system, with  hereditary chiefs arising from the daughter's children, not the son's.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny" title="Polygyny">Polygyny</a>&nbsp;is accepted, with  the first wife recognized as the senior. <br>
  </p>
                  <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      Kwanyama speak Ovambo language.<br>
                      The traditional  religion of the Kwanyama people is the primary faith of less than 3%, as most  state Christianity to be their primary faith. Kyanyama traditional religion  envisions a Supreme Being named&nbsp;<em>Kalunga</em>, with their rites and  rituals cantered on sacred fire like many ethnic groups in southwestern Africa.  The&nbsp;<em>Kalunga</em>&nbsp;cosmology states that the Supreme Being created  the first man and first woman, who had a daughter and two sons. It is the  daughter's lineage that created Kwanyama people, according to the traditional  beliefs of the matrilineal Kyanyama people. <br>
                      The rituals  involve elaborate fire making and keeping ceremonies, rain making dance, and  rites have involved throwing herbs in the fire and inhaling the rising smoke.  The head priest traditionally was the king of a tribe, and his role was in part  to attend to the supernatural spirits and be the chief representative of the  Kyanyama tribe to the deities. <br>
                      Christianity  arrived among the Kwanyama people in late 19th century. The  first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Evangelical_Lutheran_Mission" title="Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission">Finnish missionaries</a>&nbsp;arrived in  Ovamboland in the 1870s, and Kwanyama predominantly converted and thereof have  identified themselves as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>&nbsp;Christians. The  influence of the Finnish missions not only related to the religion, but  cultural practices. For example, the typical dress style of the contemporary Kwanyama  women that includes a head scarf and loose full length maxi, is derived from  those of the 19th century Finnish missionaries. <br>
                  Kwanyama  people now predominantly follow Christian theology, prayer rituals and  festivities, but some of the traditional religious practices have continued,  such as the use of ritual sacred fire. They also invoke their supreme  creator&nbsp;<em>Kalunga</em>. Thus, the Kwanyama have preferred a syncretic form  of Christianity. Most weddings feature a combination of Christian beliefs and Kwanyama  traditions. </p>
                    <p><strong>Chokwe</strong><br>
                      Also known as Ciokwe, Djok, Kioko, Quioco, Shioko, Tschiokloe, or Tshokwe <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Population  &amp; Ecosystem</strong><br>
                      460.000 Chokwe  live in woodland&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a>, but are also found along  rivers and marshland with strips of rainforest.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Economy  &amp; Society</strong><br>
                      In  the north, the Chokwe are known as skilled hunters. In south, their livelihood  has traditionally centred on cultivation of staple crops such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava" title="Cassava">cassava</a>, yams, millet, beans,  peanuts and corn (maize). Pastoral activity with cattle is also a part of the  southern Chokwe people's life. <br>
                      Chokwe are famous  for their exceptional crafts work, particularly with baskets, pottery, mask  carving, statues, stools and other handicrafts.&nbsp;The art work include  utilitarian objects, but often integrates Chokwe mythologies, oral history and  spiritual beliefs. <br>
                      Both chiefs and  village groups are found in the Chokwe culture. Villages consist of company  compounds with square huts or circular grass-houses with a central space that  serves as the meeting place for the villagers. <br>
                      The Chokwe are  traditionally a matrilineal society, but where the woman moves to live with her  husband's family after wedding. Polygyny has been a historic practice usually  limited to the chief or a wealthy family. <br>
  </p>
                  <p><strong>Culture  &amp; Religion</strong><br>
                      Chokwe  speak Kitchokwe language.<br>
                      The traditional  religious beliefs of the Chokwe centre around ancestor spirits worship. In  groups where chiefs exist, they are considered the representative of god  Kalunga, therefore revered and called&nbsp;<em>Mwanangana</em>&nbsp;or  &quot;overseer of the land&quot;. The Chokwe people believe that works of arts  such as handicrafts and carved objects are spiritual, connect them to their ancestors  and god Kalunga. With the colonial era, Chowke converted to Christianity massively  yet the original beliefs were retained to produce a syncretism of beliefs and  practices.&nbsp;They have, for example, continued their spirit-rituals from  pre-Christian era, as well maintained their elaborate rites-of-passage  ceremonies particularly to mark the entry into adulthood by men and women. <br>
                  While  facial and body scarification (popular until 1940s) have almost disappeared due  to social, economic and cultural change, masquerades are still popular in  Chokwe territory.</p>

                      Portuguese explorers  reached the coast of what today is Angola in 1482. By mid-16th  Century the Angolan northern coast and riverbanks where splashed with several  military fortress and Baroque style churches. Some of this colonial heritage  has been destroyed during the Civil War (1975-2002) but many are still  standing. Some interesting examples to visit are:<br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Cathedral of the Holy Saviour of  Congo</strong>, located in the city of M´banza Kongo (North  Angola) and today in ruins.

                      <strong>Our  Lady of the Cape Church</strong>&nbsp;-  Founded in 1575/1669. The small church of the island was dedicated to our Lady  of the Immaculate Conception. When the Portuguese regained the territory lost  to the Dutch in 1648, was erected at the same location, a new Church, but much  larger. The works just finished in 1669. The Church was called Our Lady of the  Cape. <br>

                    <p><strong>Mercy  Church</strong>&nbsp;-  Founded in 1621/1624. The Queen Leonor of Portugal ordered the construction of  the Mercy Church and of a hospital to treat military and civilian patients that  has gone from 1621 to 1624. <br>
                      </p>
                    <p><strong>Jesus  Church&nbsp;</strong>-  Founded in 1612/1636. The style is Baroque and the Church was considered at the  time &quot;the grandest structure in the southern hemisphere&quot;.<br>
                      With the Dutch occupation in 1641, the Church  served as a Parliament and Government Council. With the reconquest by the  Portuguese in 1648, became a Church again. In 1978, became the Cathedral of the  Archdiocese of Luanda. <br>
                      </p>
                    <p><strong>Our Lady of Nazareth Church</strong>&nbsp;-  Founded in 1664/1965. The small church of Our Lady of Nazareth was built in  1664, almost on the water. The facade was in front of the Bay and to the Church  of Our Lady of the Cape.<br>
                      In 1922 the  Church was regarded as a national monument. It is a replica of the Our Lady of  Nazareth, a picturesque fisherman's Beach in Portugal, full of tiles that tell  stories and miracles. Inside there is a black image of Santa Iphigenia of  Ethiopia. Today is the Church of the parish and a shrine. <br>

                  <p>Lubango&nbsp;<strong>Cathedral&nbsp;</strong>situated in  the city centre and which dates from 1939 an interesting example of Art Deco  style. <br>
                      <strong>Church Mission of Huila</strong>,  dating from 1880, one of the oldest in the province and a good example to  understand colonial missionary action in tribal areas. </p>
                    <p><strong>Colonial architecture in Luanda</strong><br>
                      Luanda is a town born in 1575 because of the  Atlantic slave trade which continued to the end&nbsp;of the 19th century  when international pressure forced it to stop.&nbsp;The next significant growth  of the city was based on the coffee industry&nbsp;(1930s-1950s)&nbsp;and now  oil is the driving force behind Luanda&rsquo;s expansion. These historical periods of  economic expansion can be understood through Luanda&rsquo;s architecture. <strong> </strong><br>

                    <p><strong>Tropical Modernist architecture of Angola</strong><br>
                  During 1930 and 1950  Angola enjoyed an economic boom mainly due to coffee and diamond export to  Europe and Brazil. Thanks to this sudden wealth many families and local  governments decided to invest in their homes, amusement sites and public  buildings. The architecture of this period is known as &lsquo;<strong>Moderno Tropical</strong>&rsquo; –<strong>Tropical  Modernist</strong>- and is characterized by a mixture of Art Deco and Modernist  styles. Good examples of this architecture can be found in <strong>Luanda</strong>, <strong>Lobito</strong>, <strong>Benguela</strong>, <strong>Lubango, Namibe, </strong>and<strong> Tombwa</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Old Cinemas of Angola</strong><br>
                      From the late colonial  modernist structures of the 1930s, to the open-air cine-esplandas that sprung  up in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, these structures served as more than just places  to catch the latest flick - they were vibrant meeting points for the local  communities. <br>
                      The <strong>Cine Atlantico</strong> (ex-<strong>Cinema Imperio</strong>) is still in use,  hosting the annual Luanda International Film Festival. Designed by the  architect Antonio Ribeiro dos Santos, the building was inaugurated in 1966 with  a screening of the film&nbsp;<em>My  Fair Lady</em>.<br>
                      The national assembly, where the parliament convenes, is housed in the <strong>Cine-Teatro Restauraçao </strong>(1956), designed  by the architect brothers Joao Garcia de Castilho and Luis Garcia de Castilho  with references to the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright and Willem Dudok.<br>

                    <p><strong>Vernacular architecture of Angola</strong><br>
                  Vernacular architecture is commonly  recognized as the fundamental expression of the world&rsquo;s cultural diversity. In  Angola best examples of vernacular architecture are found among the remote  tribes in the Southwest. An outstanding example of sophisticated and beautiful  is the one of <strong>Nguendelengo</strong> tribe  with two-storey constructions that serve as home and granary. Other beautiful  more basic type of structures are found among nomadic groups in desert areas  such as <strong>Mucubal, Mudimba</strong> and <strong>Himba </strong>tribes. The desire for  modernization and the well-known globalization phenomenon are some of the most  frequent evoked issues responsible for endangering the survival of vernacular  heritage in Africa. In Last Places we aim to highlight the outstanding  universal value of vernacular architectural heritage in Angola and to raise  awareness to the increasing need, not only the protection of these structures&rsquo;  integrity but also for the preservation of such ancient and sustainable  building techniques as a living heritage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Modern Art of Angola</strong><br>
                      The works of Angolan  painter and poet<strong> Albano Neves e Sousa </strong>(<em>1921</em>-1995)  can be admired in the lobby, restaurant, and kitchen (6 paintings in total he  did as a form of payment to the owner, an immigrant  from Galicia, Spain) of <strong>Hotel Grande  Universo</strong>, an Art Deco building from 1949, also one can admire his work in a  gigantic panel at <strong>Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport </strong>(1951) –check in area-, and in several  panels in the <strong>Museu de Historia Natural  de Angola </strong>(1956) to show the habitat of the different stuffed Angolan  animal species exposed there. He represented Angolan tribes, nature and daily  life in  what is known as &lsquo;modern-tropical&rsquo; style it would be a combination of Art Decó  and Rationalist style combined. <br>
                      Since 2005, the arts scene in oil-rich Angola has been booming. It has&nbsp;been  so strong,&nbsp;it has taken the international arts community by  surprise.&nbsp;Angola won the award for Best National Pavilion at the 2013  Venice Biennale despite it being the first time the country exhibited there.  Angola now boasts numerous prestigious galleries and cultural centres, and is  home to the <strong>Trienal de Luanda</strong>, an  annual event held&nbsp;to enhance Angolan and African culture, and stimulate  artistic interest&nbsp;in citizens. With an environment that&nbsp;supports the  arts, Angola&rsquo;s arts community is thriving. Some of the most renowned  contemporary Angolan artists would be: <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Helga Gamboa</strong> is a ceramics artist who combines traditional methods  with modern imagery. The combination often produces shocking results, such as  when glaze resembles blood pouring out of a vessel, or when a dish has a  warning on it such as &ldquo;DANGER MINES.&rdquo; Gamboa now lives and works in the U.K. <br>
                      </p>
                    <p><strong>Paulo Kussy</strong> is one of Angola&rsquo;s most  celebrated artists. His paintings are large and bold in their use of color,  often combining styles like graffiti art, Japanese printmaking and Soviet  propaganda art. Kussy left Angola at a young age and lived in many different countries  before studying art in Lisbon and eventually returning&nbsp;to Angola to  exhibit. <br>
                      </p>
                    <p><strong>Edson Chagas</strong> is one of the artists who  represented Angola in the 55th&nbsp;Venice Biennale for which the country won  the prestigious Golden Lion Award. Chagas primarily works in photography and  shows images that depict social issues, critique consumerism, and show  relationships between space and time. <br>
                      </p>
                  <p><strong>Kiluanji Kia Henda</strong> is an Angolan  photographer whose work has received international acclaim. His photographs  deal with Africa&rsquo;s colonial past by juxtaposing European and African imagery,  such as in his work, &ldquo;The Great Italian Nude,&rdquo; in which he shows an African  chief reclining on a sofa in the style of an Italian renaissance painting. </p>
                    <p><strong>Rock paintings of Angola</strong><br>
                      <strong>Tchitundo Hulo rock carvings and paintings</strong><br>
                      Discovered near <strong>Virei</strong> town in 1954, <strong>Tchitundo Hulo</strong> boasts around two  thousand carvings, mostly of geometric design. The numerous carvings show that  over an extensive period of time, this granite mount was used for different ceremonies  in which rock carvings on stone ground must have played a central&nbsp;role.  Archaeologists date<strong> Tchitundo Hulo</strong> rock carvings and paintings 20.000 years back.<strong></strong><br>
                  </p>
                    <p>The names <strong>Tchitundo-hulo Mulume</strong> and <strong>Tchitundo-hulo Mucai</strong> stand for  man and woman. The two inselbergs stand about a kilometre apart, the former has  multiple rock carvings, with an overhang or shelter with drawings on  its&nbsp;roof. <br>
                  </p>
                    <p>Archaeologist Camarate França noted that these particular inselbergs were  named &lsquo;mother and daughter&rsquo; by the local population, but the memory of why they  had been given these names has been&nbsp;lost. <br>
                      According to the reverend, &lsquo;hulo&rsquo; could mean final, or last. He adds that:  &ldquo;&lsquo;ondjila hulo&rsquo; means the final road, the end of the road, or path&rsquo;s&nbsp;end&rdquo;. <br>
                      There is a great number of star motifs, circles and abstract designs,&nbsp;and  a small number of medium to large-sized mammals. There is a marked absence of  anthropomorphic drawings. <br>
  </p>
                  <p><strong>Tribal dolls of Angola</strong><br>
                  Generally,  most dolls in Angola, as in most all of Africa, are used by children, primarily  girls,&nbsp;<strong>to help them  envisage their future roles as adult women</strong><strong>,</strong> mothers and the primary caregivers in their communities. Though  used in play, the forms of many dolls encode important social and aesthetic  concepts about appropriate demeanour and the links between physical and moral  beauty. Not surprisingly, dolls in different African societies emphasize in  both form and decoration, aspects of ideal feminine beauty. They include  elaborate coiffures, body ornamentation and physical features that underscore  the importance of fertility. </p>
                    <p>Tribes  of Southwest Angola continue to fabricate dolls. <strong>Mumuila, </strong><strong>Handa, Muhumbi, Khoisan, Mudimba, Mugambue, Himba, Muhakaona, Mutua,  Mucubal, Mucuis, Nguendelengo, </strong>and <strong>Cuepe</strong> tribe each fabricate their own  special doll. Huila Museum in Lubango exhibits a beautiful collection of tribal  dolls.<br>
                      The centre or  core of these dolls is made from a solid piece of carved wood. Fabric is  obtained from the doll maker&rsquo;s actual clothing. Plastic, wire and grass fiber  rings are as those worn by the owner as bangles. Beads decorate the  hairdo,&nbsp;which are meant to replicate the owners coiffure. The name given  to the doll will become the name of the owners first born child. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Kwanyama  dolls</strong> are amongst the rarest and most  sought after beaded artworks from southern Africa. The men of the&nbsp;<em><strong>Kwanyama </strong></em><em>peoples</em>&nbsp;of southern Angola  carved these dolls as prophecies of future children. Fathers would give these  dolls to their daughters. The dolls are rich in symbolism - the obviously  phallic shape alluded to fertility and the importance of the male while the blue  beads resemble garments worn by <strong>Kwanyama </strong>women. <br>
  <strong>Chokwe Art of Angola</strong><strong> </strong><br>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Luanda&rsquo;s <strong>National Museum of Anthropology</strong> and in <strong>Dundo Museum</strong> (Dundo, Northeast Angola) one can find examples of fine <strong>Chokwe</strong> art on of  the finest and most reputed in Africa.                                                                                                                     </p>
                    <p><strong>Chokwe </strong>artists sculpted sceptres, thrones  with figurines, fans, tobacco boxes, pipes, fly swats, cups, and figures of  chiefs or ancestors. They were famous for their large statues of deified  ancestors, exalting strength and dignity. The best-known representation of a  chief is of Chibinda Ilunga. He was a wandering hunter, youngest son of the great  Luba chief Kalala Ilunga. The most powerful and important <strong>Chokwe</strong> mask is  known as&nbsp;chikunga. Highly  charged with power and considered sacred,&nbsp;chikunga&nbsp;is used during investiture ceremonies of a chief  and sacrifices to the ancestors. These masks are made of backcloth stretched  over an armature of wickerwork, covered over with black resin and painted with  red and white designs.&nbsp; <br>
                      While in former times they probably played  important roles in religious beliefs and institutional practices, many other <strong>Chokwe </strong>masks have come to be used primarily for entertainment. Itinerant actors  wearing these masks travel from village to village, living on gifts received at  performances. Most masks are carved of wood. During the 17th&nbsp;century  many <strong>Chokwe</strong> chiefs were introduced to chairs imported by Portuguese  officials and adopted the foreign style for their thrones. However, <strong>Chokwe </strong>style  and decoration were saved. The figures on the back, stretchers, and legs were  typical <strong>Chokwe </strong>carving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Basketry of Angola</strong><br>
                      Basket making is still  popular among Southwest tribes. <strong>Mudimba</strong>, <strong>Mugambue</strong>, <strong>Mumuila</strong>, and <strong>Muhumbi</strong> women are among the best basket weavers in Angola. <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Santiago Beach shipwrecks</strong><br>
                      One hour drive north of  Luanda we find <strong>Santiago Beach</strong>, a  beautiful natural enclave (unfortunately the way to the beach is accompanied by  piles of garbage from nearby Luanda). In this beach more than twenty abandoned  boats rot on the beach. Stunning images that give the area an  &lsquo;end-of-the-World&rsquo; aspect.<br>

                    <p><strong>Music of Angola</strong><br>
                      The&nbsp;<strong>music  of Angola</strong>&nbsp;has been shaped both by wider musical trends and by  the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Angola" title="History of Angola">political history</a>&nbsp;of the country. While Angolan music  has also influenced the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusophone_music" title="Lusophone music">music of the other Lusophone countries</a>. In turn, the music of Angola was  instrumental in creating and reinforcing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angolanidade" title="Angolanidade">angolanidade</a>, the Angolan national identity. <br>
                      Luanda is home to  a diverse group of styles: <br>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kilapanda&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Kilapanda (page does not exist)">Kilapanda</a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouk" title="Zouk">Zouk</a></strong><strong>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semba" title="Semba">Semba</a>,&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizomba" title="Kizomba">Kizomba</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuduro" title="Kuduro">Kuduro</a></strong>. Just off the  coast of Luanda is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ilha_do_Cabo&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Ilha do Cabo (page does not exist)">Ilha do Cabo</a>, home to an&nbsp;aaccordion and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica" title="Harmonica">harmonica</a>-based style of music called<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebita" title="Rebita">Rebita</a></strong>. <br>
                      Belonging to the  same family as Brazilian&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba" title="Samba">Samba</a>&nbsp;but distinct from that genre, <strong>Semba </strong>is the predecessor to a variety  of music styles originating in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Three of the most famous of these are <strong>Samba</strong> itself (which was created by  Angolan&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Brazil" title="Slavery in Brazil">slaves</a>),&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizomba" title="Kizomba">Kizomba</a></strong><strong>,</strong> and&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuduro" title="Kuduro">Kuduro</a></strong><strong>.</strong> <br>
                      The subject  matter of <strong>Semba </strong>is often a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cautionary_tale" title="Cautionary tale">cautionary tale</a>&nbsp;or story regarding day-to-day life  and social events and activities, usually sung in a witty rhetoric. Through <strong>Semba </strong>music, the artist is able to  convey a broad spectrum of emotions. It is this characteristic that has made <strong>Semba</strong> the premiere style of music for a  wide variety of Angolan social gatherings. Its versatility is evident in its  inevitable presence at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral" title="Funeral">funerals</a>&nbsp;and, on the other hand, many Angolan&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parties" title="Parties">parties</a>. <br>
  <strong>Semba</strong> is very much alive and popular in Angola today as it was long before that  country's independence from the Portuguese colonial system on November 11,  1975. Various new <strong>Semba</strong> artists  emerge each year in Angola, as they render homage to the veteran <strong>Semba</strong> masters, many of whom are still  performing. Other styles related to the <strong>Semba</strong> is&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebita" title="Rebita">Rebita</a></strong>, which is  inspired by European&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_dancing" title="Line dancing">line dances</a>, as well as <strong>Kazukuta </strong>and <strong>Kabetula</strong> which are primarily&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival" title="Carnival">Carnival</a>&nbsp;Music. <br>
                      Barceló de  Carvalho, the Angolan singer popularly known as&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonga_(musician)" title="Bonga (musician)">Bonga</a></strong>, is arguably the most successful Angolan artist to  popularize <strong>Semba</strong> music  internationally; it is generally being categorized as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_music" title="World music">World music</a>. <br>
                      In the 1800s  Angolan musicians in the cities experimented with popular styles worldwide,  including waltzes and ballads. With the first half of the 20th century  came big bands, who sang in both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimbundu_language" title="Kimbundu language">Kimbundu</a>.  <br>
                      The first group  to become known outside of Angola was&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duo_Ouro_Negro" title="Duo Ouro Negro">Duo Ouro Negro</a>, created in 1956. They played&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizomba" title="Kizomba">Kizomba</a></strong>&nbsp;(a native  style based around the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimba" title="Marimba">marimba</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylophone" title="Xylophone">xylophone</a>), using the four guitars to approximate  the sound of the marimba, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quilapanga&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Quilapanga (page does not exist)">quilapanga</a>. <br>
                      After  independence came&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angolan_Civil_War" title="Angolan Civil War">civil war</a>. Many popular musicians were killed, and  some who were spared simply left the country. <br>
                      In the early  1980s, Angolan popular music was deeply influenced by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Cuba" title="Music of Cuba">Cuban music</a>, especially in the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andr%C3%A9_Mingas&action=edit&redlink=1" title="André Mingas (page does not exist)">Andre  Mingas</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Rumba" title="Cuban Rumba">Cuban Rumba</a>&nbsp;was popular and influential across  southern Africa, including Angola's neighbour&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaire" title="Zaire">Zaire</a>&nbsp;(renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo),  where it became the basis for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soukous" title="Soukous">soukous</a>. In addition to the spread of recorded  Cuban music, the presence of Cuban troops allied with the Marxist&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPLA" title="MPLA">MPLA</a>&nbsp;movement helped to popularize Cuban rhythms. <br>
                      Two of the most  well-known songs from Angola are <strong>Humbi  Hummbi</strong> - written by Filipe Mukenga and <strong>Mushima</strong> (origin unknown). Music is of great importance in the Angolan lifestyle. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since the end of  the Civil War (1975-2002) an electronic music movement, called&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuduro" title="Kuduro">Kuduro</a></strong>, has blossomed  in Angola. It combines traditional Angolan <strong>Kilapanga</strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semba" title="Semba">Semba</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soca_music" title="Soca music">Soca</a></strong>&nbsp;with Western&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music" title="House music">house</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno" title="Techno">techno</a>. <br>
                  Despite the rise  of <strong>Kuduro</strong> the most popular genre  today continues to be&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizomba" title="Kizomba">Kizomba</a></strong>. The <strong>Kizomba</strong> rhythm and movement is derived  from an up-beat Semba, meaning ´a touch of the bellies, ´ which is a  characteristic posture of the dance. </p>

                  </p>
                    <p><strong>Miradouro  da Lua</strong><br>
                      Miraduoro da Lua  or Moon Viewpoint is one of the greatest sightseeing places in Angola. It is  located south (one hour drive) from Luanda. Miraduoro da Lua boasts of  breath-taking landscape which consists of rock formations created over thousands  of years by rain and wind erosion. Thus, Miraduoro da Lua reminds of the  surface of the moon. <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Kissama National Park</strong><br>
                      With 12.000&nbsp;km² Kissama or Quiçama National  Park is Angola's most  accessible (1h drive south of Luanda) and well-stocked wildlife park. This huge  swathe of coastal savannah punctuated by gnarly baobab trees is home to  elephants, zebras, giraffes, ostriches, and wildebeests imported from game  reserves in South Africa and Botswana. Kissama National Park remains at the  forefront of Angola's wildlife regeneration efforts despite of years of  poaching and neglect during the civil war. <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Kalandula Falls</strong><br>
                      Kalandula Falls lie in the course of the Lucala  River and are the second highest in Africa with a drop of 105 meters.&nbsp;They  can be photographed from above (mirador) and down. <br>

                    <p><strong>Pedras  Negras of Pungo Andongo</strong><strong> </strong><br>
                      Pedras Negras  or&nbsp;Black Rocks at <strong>Pungo Andongo</strong>&nbsp;are  a series of mysterious&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_formation" title="Rock formation">rock formations</a> standing high above the flat savannah.  These giant black&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith" title="Monolith">monoliths</a>&nbsp;are associated with&nbsp;Queen Nzinga  who resisted the Portuguese invasion in this area in the 17th  Century. <br>
  </p>
                    <p><strong>Iona National Park</strong><br>
                  Iona National Park is one  of Africa&rsquo;s wildest and most virgin ecosystems. It is also one of Angola&rsquo;s  largest national parks, covering 15,200&nbsp;km2 including the mouth  of the Cunene River, Tigres Island and extensive sand spit, and about 200 km of  Atlantic coastline. The fauna (decimated during the long Civil War) is composed  of Springbok (Gazelle), Kudu, Ostrich, Oryx, Mountain Zebra, Impala, Klipspringer,  jackal, spotted hyena, brown fur seal, and (very rare) cheetah. The park is rich in birdlife, especially along the coastal pans and  river basins. Many rippled rows of sand dunes can be seen near the coast,  making this vast, remote landscape a photographer&rsquo;s dream.                                                                                                                                                                       Iona  National Park is also known for its unique flora – including the stunning  Welwitschia Mirabilis (one of the world&rsquo;s oldest living plants) – and  incredible rock formations. Iona National Park is also home to many indigenous  peoples such as the </p>
                    <p><strong>Mucubal, Mucuis,  Cuepe, Muhakaona, Mutua </strong>and <strong>Himba</strong>,  as well as some Kimbundu groups (brought by the Portuguese as slaves from the  North to build roads, railways, and ports). Most are subsistent farmers and  herders who remain isolated and oblivious to the outside world. The indigenous  people of this region have been studied by anthropologists, who say they are  the most culturally intact on the African continent.<br>

                      Tigres&nbsp;Island  also known as Angola&rsquo;s Ghost Island is a small isolated and unpopulated island  in the southwestern region of Angola with a land mass of 98&nbsp;km².  &nbsp;As the largest and only sandy island off the coast of the 2000 km-long  Namib Desert, it remains the least known coastal wetland along desert coast  rich in shorebirds.&nbsp;                                                                                                                         <br>
                      The&nbsp;Island&nbsp;was&nbsp;once a thriving commercial fishing community  in the Portuguese colonial era, connected to the mainland by a small sand causeway.  &nbsp;The inhabitants abandoned the Island in 1974 to escape the strong wind,  lack of drinking water and the transportation difficulties to the mainland.  &nbsp;Filled with hundreds of abandoned Portuguese-style buildings and  properties, the structures are now being enveloped by the continual blowing  sand. Though the waters surrounding the island are very rich in fish stocks,  the location is&nbsp;renowned&nbsp;for  its birdlife.&nbsp;Two surveys of the Island region in 1999 and 2001  indicated a rich wetland bird diversity consisting of 25 species and a bird  density of 33 birds per square kilometre.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Island&nbsp;is only  visited now by adventure-seeking tourist groups.&nbsp; <br>

                    <p><strong>Serra  da Chela and Leba Pass</strong><strong> </strong><br>
                      One of the top  places to hike and admire amazing views over Namib Desert is Serra da Chela. It  consists of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range" title="Mountain range">mountain range</a> rising to 2,306&nbsp;meters above the  coastal plains, separating the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hu%C3%ADla_Plateau&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Huíla Plateau (page does not exist)">Huíla Plateau</a>&nbsp;of the interior from the low-lying  coastal&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namib_Desert" title="Namib Desert">Namib Desert</a>. Interesting flora and fauna can be found  in its desne forests and the <strong>Nguendelengo</strong> tribal group that lives in deep valleys inside this mountain range. There are  two ways to cross Serra da Chela by car; through Bibala in a recently  constructed road and trough the famous <strong>Leba Pass</strong>.  It is a high mountain pass at an elevation of 1.845 meters above the sea level.  The road to the top is asphalted and pretty steep. <br>
                      </p>
                    <p><strong>Tunda Vala</strong><strong> </strong><br>
                      Tunda  Vala is a breath-taking gorge cut out of the Serra da Chela mountain range looking  towards the Namib Desert valley. A concrete viewing platform has been built at  the point where a deep ravine slices into the edge of the vertical cliff. At  the bottom of the cliff some 1,000 meters below is a wide green plateau  punctuated with odd-shaped hills that stretches to the sea over 130 kilometers  away at Namibe. To get a feel for the height of the cliff, toss a stone over  the edge and count until it hits the bottom – usually about eight seconds.  Here, above the clouds, the air is clear and you may see the occasional eagle  and monkey. <br>

                    <p><strong>Luengue-Luiana  National Park</strong>&nbsp; <br>
                      Luengue-Luiana National Park is the largest park  in Angola with 30,000 km2,  roughly the size of Belgium. The park is part of the larger Kavango-Zambezi  Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA), the biggest protected area in Africa  comprising also Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The Angola side is  still wild and difficult to visit for tourists but the potential is enormous. A  National Geographic visited the park in 2017, surveying water quality, plant  and animal species and human impact on the environment. They started the  two-month expedition at the source of the Cubango river, which supplies much of  the water in Botswana's Okavango Delta, a UNESCO World Heritage site. <br>
